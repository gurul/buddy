  Where the watcher's requests connect (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/watch.py). Line numbers are those of watch.py
  as reviewed (1792 lines, before the fix). The property the module docstring states ("URLs to private,
  loopback or link-local addresses are refused, redirects included") and `render`'s ("a page cannot point the
  browser at the LAN"):

    every connection the watcher opens, by urllib or by the headless browser, goes to a public address.

  How the code checks it. urllib (`http_request`, :644-674): `check_url` (:598-610) resolves the host with
  `_public` (:580-595, `socket.getaddrinfo`) and refuses a non-public answer; then `opener.open` connects, and
  http.client resolves the host AGAIN (`socket.create_connection`). A redirect is checked the same way, by
  `_GuardedRedirects` (:613-621), with its own two lookups. The browser (`render`, :742-792): the first URL
  passes `check_url`; each request the page makes passes `guard` (:757-765), whose `_public` answer is cached
  per host, and Chromium then resolves the host itself. But `page.route` is not called for a redirect's next
  hop (nor for a WebSocket or a popup's requests, which the replay test also shows), so such a hop is
  connected with no check at all.

  Abstraction. DNS is the attacker's: each lookup of a name may answer a public (`pub`) or a private (`priv`)
  address, the check's lookup and the connect's lookup independently (a rebinding name with TTL 0). An IP
  literal answers the same to both, which is a special case. Events: `fetch c k` is one urllib request or
  redirect hop whose check's lookup answers `c` and whose connect's answers `k`; `browse c k` a browser request
  `guard` sees; `unguarded k` a browser connection `guard` never sees (a redirect hop, a WebSocket, a popup),
  whose connect answers `k`. The ghost `bad` records a connection to a private address.

  The fix: urllib connects through `_connect_public`, which resolves once and refuses unless every answer is
  public, then connects to one of those very addresses (the check and the connect are one lookup). The browser
  goes through a guard that sees every connection (a local proxy that makes the same check on the address it
  connects to; `--proxy-bypass-list=<-loopback>` so loopback is not exempt), so `unguarded` becomes `browse`.
  Both fixes are in watch.py (2026-09-25): `_connect_public` behind `_PinnedHTTP(S)Handler` for urllib, and
  `_GuardProxy` for the browser (Chromium launched with it as its proxy and `<-loopback>` as the bypass list,
  in a child process with a deadline). The Python replays: test_watch_security.py's rebinding test, and the
  live browser test, whose negative control (the same page with the guard letting everything through) reaches
  the LAN by beacon, fetch, iframe, popup, redirect and WebSocket.
  Bound: none. The step lemma is checked on both states and all 10 events; `fixed_invariant` then holds for
  every trace of any length, by induction.

  Since this model (re-verification, 2026-09-25): "public" also excludes every address inside a prefix on one of
  this Mac's own interfaces (`_local_networks`, from ifconfig; a home network's IPv6 devices have global
  addresses), and no global IPv6 address at all when the interfaces cannot be read. The proxy carries one request
  per plain-http connection (a kept-alive connection used to carry the next request to the first server). A
  render past its deadline is killed with every process under it: Chromium runs in a process group of its own.
