/-
  The watcher's scheduler (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/watch.py, class Watcher): its loop (`run`, `tick`,
  `_run_one`, `check`) and its chat tools (`add`, `remove`), on one asyncio event loop. Everything between
  two awaits is atomic. The Telegram brain calls one tool at a time (telegram.py sends
  `parallel_tool_calls: False`, and a turn runs under `_turn_lock`), but the loop runs beside a turn.

  Line numbers are those of watch.py as verified (1792 lines, before the fix).

  Part 1, the list. The properties:

    (1) no two watches on the list share an id, and no id the owner was ever given names a second watch;
    (2) a watch the owner removed is never checked again once `remove()` returns, and nothing more is
        texted about it, even when `tick` had already picked it or its check was already reading.

  The current code keeps the list's ids distinct and never starts a check of a removed watch (the guard
  `if w not in self.watches`, :1476, runs after the lock with no await before the read). It breaks the
  rest: a check already reading when the watch is removed still texts its alert (:1487-1489), its
  "I can't read" (:1482-1484) and its "I can read X again" (:1453-1455); and `_new_id` (:1573-1578) is
  1 + the largest id on the list, so removing the newest watch hands its id to the next one.

  Abstraction. A watch is a number (`o`, the Python object, fresh per `validate`) with an id (`wN` as
  `N`). `pick o` is tick taking `o` from its sorted snapshot (:1495); any watch ever made may be picked,
  which covers a snapshot that is stale by any amount. `enter` is `_run_one` getting the lock and running
  the guard; `ret r` is the check's read returning (:1434) with what it leads to; each text is its own
  `send`, since each `_tell` is an await. `validate` is `add` calling `validate` -> `_new_id` (:1633);
  `queue` is the limiter-busy path (:1643-1646), `lock` the `async with self._lock` of :1650, `keep` the
  append of :1665, `drop` a 400/404/410 or unknown symbol (:1660-1663). `remove i` is `remove()`
  (:1564-1571): the first watch with id `i` leaves the list. The Watcher's lock is left out: letting `add`'s
  first check and the loop's check overlap only adds traces, so an invariant proved without it holds with
  it. `add` is one at a time (the turn lock); `remove` may come at any point, even inside an `add`, which
  again only adds traces. `w not in self.watches` compares dataclasses by value; it is modelled as identity,
  which it equals whenever two watches differ in any field (their ids, by (1)). Proofs are over every trace,
  by induction, with no bound.

  Part 2, the via ladder and the error notices, per watch (`Ladder`, `Notice`); part 3, the loop's wake-up
  (`Wake`); part 4, a check that raises something other than FetchError (`Starve`). Each says what it
  abstracts where it starts.

  After this model (2026-09-25): a send the owner never received is outside it. `_tell` now returns whether the
  notice went; an alert Telegram refused is kept on the watch (`pending`) and sent again at the next tick, and
  `told_error` is set only when "I can't read" went. With every send succeeding, as here, both are the modelled
  behaviour.

/-! ## Part 2: the via ladder and the error notices, per watch

  Every check of a watch on the list runs under the Watcher's lock (`_run_one`, :1475), and `add`'s first
  checks run under it too before the watch is listed (:1650), so one watch's checks are a sequence. The
  ladder and the notices are two small machines over that sequence. They share only the `refused` event:
  a 401/403 either moves the ladder (:1436-1444, no error counted) or is an ordinary failure, so the notice
  machine takes `refusedLadder` as a step that changes nothing and `failed` for the rest. Each machine
  allows its events in any order, which covers every sequence the combined code can produce.

  `page` is `w.kind == "page"`; `browser` is `self.config.browser` (fixed for the process). The notice
  machine assumes `self.notify` is set, as the daemon sets it before the loop starts (daemon.py:394); a
  "tell" is the `_tell` call, whether or not Telegram then delivers it. -/

/-! ## Part 3: the loop's wake-up

  `run` (:1512-1525): `wait = await self.tick()`, then `self._wake.clear()`, then
  `asyncio.wait_for(self._wake.wait(), timeout=min(wait, 300.0))`. `tick` returns
  `max(1.0, min(w.next_at for w in self.watches) - now)` (:1507), computed after its last await, over the
  list as it is then. `add` appends and sets the event with no await between (:1644-1646, and :1665-1667:
  releasing an asyncio.Lock does not suspend). `Event.wait` returns at once when the flag is already set.

  `late` is a ghost: some listed watch was appended after the loop's current wait was computed. The property:
  while the loop sleeps, a watch it did not count has the flag set, so the sleep ends at once and the next tick
  sees it; a watch it did count bounds the sleep by its own due time. Abstraction: time is left out (the
  bound is what `tick` returned); `tick` is assumed to return, which is what `_run_one` catching every
  exception (the fix to part 4) makes true of its checks. -/

/-! ## Part 4: a check that raises something other than FetchError

  `tick` (:1495-1504) walks the watches in `next_at` order. `_run_one` catches only FetchError (:1480), so
  anything else a reader or a rule raises (a model reply with a string for `choices[0].message`, AttributeError
  in `_reply_text`; a drop_pct baseline of 0, ZeroDivisionError in `evaluate`) leaves `tick` before `next_at`
  moved. `run` logs it and sleeps 60 s (:1519-1520), and the same watch, still the earliest, is first again.

  A watch is its outcome this tick (`fine`, `raises`, or `held` by the limiter, :1498-1501) and whether it is
  due. The list is in `next_at` order; a raising watch keeps its `next_at`, so a list that starts with one is
  in order again after the tick. The property: one tick leaves no due watch due (each is checked, backed off,
  or pushed back by the limiter). -/
