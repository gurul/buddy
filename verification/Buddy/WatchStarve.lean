  One broken watch and the rest of the list (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/watch.py, `Watcher.tick`, `_run_one`,
  `check`, `run`). Line numbers are those of watch.py as reviewed (1792 lines, before the fix).

  `tick` (:1491-1507) walks the watches sorted by `next_at` and checks each one that is due. `check` (:1427-1461)
  moves `next_at` on a reading (:1460) and on a FetchError (:1450), but a read that raises anything else leaves
  `check` with `next_at` unchanged; `_run_one` (:1474-1489) catches only FetchError, so the exception leaves
  `tick` too, and `run` (:1513-1520) logs it and ticks again 60 s later. Such reads exist: `http_request`
  (:644-674) lets out `LookupError` for a `charset=` Python does not know (:674) and `http.client.BadStatusLine`
  or `LineTooLong` for a malformed answer (neither is an OSError), and they come from whoever serves the page.
  The watch keeps the oldest `next_at`, so it is first again on every tick. The property:

    every watch that is due when a tick starts is taken up by that tick: checked, counted as an error, or
    pushed back by the limiter. (So a due watch never waits behind another one for longer than a tick.)

  Abstraction. A watch is `due` or not, with its successful `checks` and its `errors`. One tick is one pass over
  the list in its sorted order; the list's order in the model is that order. `tick os` gives each watch in turn
  its outcome: `ok` (a reading, :1452-1461), `fetchErr` (FetchError, :1435-1451), `limited` (the limiter says
  wait, :1498-1501, next_at pushed back) or `crash` (any other exception). A missing outcome is `ok`. `pass m`
  is time passing: the watches marked in `m` become due. Two ghosts per watch: `wasDue` (due when this tick
  reached the list) and `seen` (this tick took it up). The first check of `add` (:1630-1680) is left out: it
  runs one watch, not the list.

  The fix (a `except Exception` in `check` that counts the error, moves `next_at` as a FetchError does, and
  re-raises it as a FetchError) makes a crash one more `fetchErr`. Bound: none. `fixed_invariant` holds for
  every list of watches, in any order, and every trace of any length, by induction on the list and the trace.

  Where the fix is (re-verification, 2026-09-25): not in `check`, as the paragraph above proposed, but in
  `_run_one` (`except Exception`: the error is counted, `next_at` moves by the same stretch as a FetchError, the
  tick goes on) and in `add` (a first check that raises keeps the watch, "the first check failed"). The rule now
  runs before the error streak is cleared, so a rule that raises adds to the streak. The stretch's exponent is
  capped, since 2.0 ** 1024 overflowed at the 1025th failure and raised out of the except itself.
