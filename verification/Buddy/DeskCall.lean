  Buddy.DeskCall — the board's hold-to-talk button, the Mac microphone, the wake word, and the Telegram chat's
  one call listener, shared by desk calls and phone calls.

  Models:
  - bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/desk_call.py: `DeskCalls.press` / `_down` / `_up` / `_start`, and the `finally`
    of its `run`;
  - bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/phone_call.py: `Call.run` (its `listen(say)` and its `finally`) and
    `PhoneCalls._serve`;
  - bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/telegram.py: `TelegramInlet.listen`, which sets the single `_call_say`;
  - bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/daemon.py: the `ptt` branch of `_handle_ble`, `_wake_suppressed`, and
    `phone_busy` in `_desk_calls_get`.
  Line numbers are those of the fixed files.

  The properties, over every trace of events:
  - (P1) the desk microphone is open only while the button is held;
  - (P2) the chat's call listener belongs only to a live call, and the most recently started call that is still
    live keeps it: a call that ends never clears a listener that a live call relies on;
  - (P3) the wake word is suppressed while the button is held.
  "The button" is the board's last `ptt` edge (ghost state `button`).

  Findings (all confirmed against the code, each replayed in bridge/tests/test_desk_call_lean.py):
  - P2, the suspected bug. `DeskCalls._down` refuses to start while a phone call is on (`busy`, desk_call.py:268),
    but `PhoneCalls._serve` (phone_call.py:638-646) checks only for another *phone* call. A phone call starting
    during a desk call runs `listen(phone.say)` (phone_call.py:564), replacing the desk's reader. When the desk
    call ended, its `Call.run` `finally` ran `listen(None)`, clearing the PHONE call's reader: the rest of the
    phone call was texted, not spoken. Fix: an ending call passes its own reader, `listen(None, owner=self.say)`
    (phone_call.py:599), and `TelegramInlet.listen` clears only if the caller is still the listener
    (telegram.py:3560).
  - P1, a tap. Every line from the board is its own task (serial_transport.py `asyncio.create_task(on_message)`),
    and `_down` opened the mic only after `await link.set_ring("listening")`, a serial write. A release landing
    during that write ran `_up` first (no mic yet); the press then opened the mic with the button up, and nothing
    closed it until the call ended. Fix: the mic opens before that await (desk_call.py:283-285).
  - P1, a conversation. The `ptt` branch dropped every edge during a conversation. A release during a
    conversation that opened after the press (a think-aloud lesson needs no wake word) left the mic open. Fix:
    only a press is ignored, a release always reaches the desk (daemon.py:2607).
  - P3. `_wake_suppressed` read `DeskCalls.held`, which the call's `finally` clears (desk_call.py:319) and which a
    press during a conversation never sets. A call that ends mid-hold (a stop; live, a press that lands while the
    quiet end's cleanup awaits) brought the wake word back while the button was held. Fix: the daemon keeps the
    board's last edge, `_ptt_held` (daemon.py:2606), and `_wake_suppressed` reads it (daemon.py:994).

  Abstractions, stated:
  - The chat and the voice are set up (`brain`, `voice` not None), and `listen(say)` returns True.
  - A desk call's start is atomic with the press that starts it: `_start` creates the task, and `Call.run`'s
    `listen(say)` runs on the next loop step. A call's end is atomic: `Call.run`'s `finally` and `run`'s `finally`.
  - `quietEnd` happens only while `held` is false: the keepalive pings while `self.held` (desk_call.py:306), and a
    quiet end needs `QUIET_SECS` (30 s) without a message. `stopEnd` is any other end: `stop`, the hour, a close.
  - A phone call that replaces an older one (phone_call.py:638-644) waits for the old one's `finally`, so it is
    `phoneEnd` followed by `phoneStart`; a `phoneStart` while a phone call is live does nothing.
  - `resume` is the `_down` that was waiting on the ring's serial write going on. In the fixed code nothing the
    properties read happens after that await.
