  Which USB node the robot link opens (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/serial_transport.py, `_resolve_port`).

  Two ESP32-S3 boards are on USB: the StackChan robot and the Voice PE controller (controller.py). Both
  report USB VID 0x303A (`_ESP32S3_VID`) and differ only by USB serial number (an ESP32-S3's is its MAC).
  The robot link opens the glob `/dev/cu.usbmodem*`; the controller link opens `usbsn:<serial>`
  (controller.py `Controller.__init__`, `USB_SERIAL_PREFIX + serial_number`). The daemon passes the
  controller's serial as the robot's `skip_serials` (daemon.py `Daemon.__init__`,
  `skip_serials=frozenset({ctl_serial}) if ctl_serial else frozenset()`, `ctl_serial` from
  `controller_serial()`, i.e. `CC_BUDDY_CONTROLLER_SERIAL`, stripped, `None` when empty).

  The bug. Before 2026-09-26 `_resolve_port` had no skip: among the glob's matches it returned the first
  Espressif node in `sorted()` order. On 2026-09-26 that was live: the daemon opened the Voice PE
  (`/dev/cu.usbmodem101`) as the robot while the StackChan (`/dev/cu.usbmodem31201`) sat idle, because
  "101" sorts before "31201". `current_violates` is that trace.

  The property (`fixed_invariant`), for every node list and every skip set:
    (a) the glob's pick is never a node whose USB serial is in skip;
    (b) the glob's pick, when there is one, is one of the nodes;
    (c) a `usbsn:s` pick, when there is one, is a node whose serial is s.
  `fixed_picks_espressif`: when an Espressif node in the glob is not skipped, the glob picks an Espressif node.

  Replay: `test_two_esp32_boards_are_told_apart_by_usb_serial` in bridge/tests/test_serial_transport.py runs
  the same four nodes through the real `_resolve_port` (the controller sorts first with no skip; the robot
  with the controller's serial skipped; each board by `usbsn:`).

  Abstraction.
  - A node is one entry: its device name, whether the glob matches it (`inGlob`), whether
    `list_ports.comports()` lists it (`listed`), whether its name has "/cu." (`cu`), its VID and its serial.
    Device names are distinct (one comports entry per device), so the Python's "any port with this device
    has a skipped serial" is the node's own serial.
  - Device names are Nat, ordered as numbers; `sorted()` orders the Python strings. The two agree on the
    live trace (101 < 31201, "101" < "31201"). (a)-(c) and `fixed_picks_espressif` hold for any order.
  - Serials are already normalised: the Python lower-cases the wanted serial (`.strip().lower()`), every
    port's serial and every skip entry (`.lower()`); the model compares them as given.
  - `(p.serial_number or "")` is `serial.getD ""`. A glob match that comports does not list has no VID and
    is never skipped (`vids.get(d)` is None; no port matches it in the skip filter).

  Not modelled.
  - A pattern with no "*" is returned as is.
  - An exception from `list_ports.comports()`. In the glob branch the Python then falls back to the glob
    alone: the skip filter sits inside the `try`, so it does not run, and `hits[0]` is returned, which can be
    the controller. (a) holds only when enumeration succeeds. In the `usbsn:` branch an exception returns
    None, which (c) allows.
