  How far buddy's speech runs ahead of the Voice PE's speaker (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/desk_call.py,
  class BoardSpeaker: `ahead`, `play`, `flush`).

  `play` sends the reply to the board in pieces of at most PCM_PIECE_BYTES (100 ms of audio). Speech
  arrives faster than it plays and the board's buffer holds 12 s, so the daemon paces itself. The property:

    after every event, the daemon is at most LEAD_SECS (3 s) ahead of the board's playback,
    where `ahead()` is `max(0, queued - (clock - started))`.

  The bug. The first `play` slept for `wait = ahead - LEAD` when that was positive, then sent the piece.
  With `ahead` exactly LEAD, `wait` is 0, the piece goes, and `ahead` becomes LEAD plus one piece. The
  counterexample (`current_violates`): 31 pieces of 100 ms from rest, with no time passing, leave the daemon
  3.1 s ahead. The pytest `test_the_daemon_stays_at_most_three_seconds_ahead_of_the_board`
  (bridge/tests/test_desk_call.py) replays it: 10 s of audio, 100 pieces, on a fake clock that moves only
  when the daemon sleeps. On the old code it ended 3.1 s ahead (3.1 > 3.0) after 6.9 s of sleep; the fix
  ends 3.0 s ahead after 7.0 s of sleep (`replays_the_pytest`).

  The fix (desk_call.py `play`, the line `wait = self.ahead() + len(piece) / BYTES_PER_SEC - LEAD_SECS`):
  make room for the whole piece before it goes, `wait = ahead + piece - LEAD`. `fixed_invariant` proves
  `ahead <= LEAD` after every event of every trace, for every LEAD and every piece p with p <= LEAD.

  Abstraction.
  * Time is a natural number of 100 ms ticks. LEAD_SECS is 30 ticks; the theorems take any LEAD. A piece
    is p ticks; the Python's pieces are 1 tick, and the last one of a reply can be shorter (it is still at
    most 1 tick). The Python uses floats; the pytest allows 1e-9 of rounding, which ticks do not have.
  * Nat subtraction is the `max(0, ...)` of `ahead` and of `if wait > 0`: a truncated `wait` of 0 is no sleep.
  * `started = None` is modelled as `started := now, queued := 0`. Both give `ahead = 0`, and the next
    piece starts a new burst either way. `flush` sets it so.
  * An event is the clock moving on by d (`tick d`), `flush`, or one piece of `play` (`send p late`):
      - if `ahead` is 0 the board ran dry, and a new burst starts: `started = now, queued = 0`;
      - the daemon sleeps `wait` (`asyncio.sleep`);
      - `late` is any further time that passes before `queued` grows: an oversleep, or the `await send`.
        The Python's `asyncio.sleep` never returns early, so `late >= 0` covers every real schedule;
      - `queued += p`.
    The loop in `play` is a run of `send` events; time between replies is `tick`.
  * The two `self.clock()` calls in one piece (the reset check and the `wait`) have no `await` between
    them, so they read the same instant; the model reads `now` once.
  * The property is checked after each event. Inside a sleep, `ahead` only falls.
