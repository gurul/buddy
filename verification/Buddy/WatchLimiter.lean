  The watcher's rate limiter (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/watch.py, class RateLimiter, lines 189-272) and
  the gate the Watcher puts in front of every read (Watcher.tick 1491-1508, Watcher.add 1630-1672).
  Line numbers are those of watch.py as read on 2026-09-25 (untracked on branch feat/watch).

  Properties, in plain words:

    1. The bucket never holds more than `burst` tokens, and a clock that moves back and forth mints no
       token: after any trace, the bucket equals a reference bucket driven by the monotone clock (the
       largest reading the limiter has taken so far).                                      [holds]
    2. A `take` made while the last `ready_in` said 0 (and no take came between) never leaves the bucket
       below 0; only a take without asking first can go into debt.                          [holds]
    3. `penalize` returns a value >= min(retry_after, backoff_max) and <= backoff_max; strikes grow by
       one; the ladder step (the part without Retry-After) never shrinks between clears; the first
       penalty after a clear is min(backoff_max, backoff_base).                             [holds]
       And: a penalty never moves the end of a hold still in force earlier; the server's Retry-After
       stands until a success clears it.                                       [BROKEN, fixed below]
    4. `model_ok` is false exactly when `model_used` was called `cap` times with today's day label;
       a day label never seen before starts at 0.                              [BROKEN, fixed below]
    5. (Watcher) no read goes to a host while the host is held by a penalty.  [BROKEN, fixed below]

  Every theorem is general: any parameters, any trace length. Nothing is bounded, except the concrete
  counterexample traces. Core Lean only; the proofs are `decide`, `simp`, `omega` and induction.

  Abstraction.
  * Time is a natural number of seconds. The Python clock is a float; `fwd d` and `back d` move it.
  * Rate: one token per `P` seconds (the default 12/min is P = 5). Tokens are kept in units of 1/P
    token, so a second of refill is one unit, `burst` is `B * P` units and a take is `P` units. This
    is exact for every rate 1/P with whole-second clock steps; `tok` is an Int (a forced take can go
    below 0: watch.py:236).
  * The four parts of RateLimiter touch disjoint fields and share only the clock: the bucket
    (`_tokens`, `_refilled`), the host gap (`_last`), the backoff (`_strikes`, `_until`) and the
    model cap (`_model_day`, `_model_n`). `ready_in` writes only the bucket (through `_refill`);
    `take` writes the bucket and `_last`. So each part is modelled on its own and every trace of the
    class projects onto a trace of each part. The host gap needs no model: `_last` is written only by
    `take` and read only by `ready_in` as `max(0, last + gap - now)`, which can only delay.
  * The backoff dicts are keyed by host and every method touches one key, so one host is modelled.
    `retry_after` is a Nat, 0 standing for None or <= 0 (watch.py:244).
  * The model cap's day label is `now / L`. A clock stepped back across midnight, or the Mac's time
    zone moved west, is a `back` that crosses a multiple of L.
  * Property 1's monotone clock is the largest reading the limiter took (at a `ready_in` or `take`).
    A forward excursion of the clock that no call read is invisible to any limiter; the refill it
    skipped is credited when the clock next passes the mark, which is real elapsed time.
  * Part E (the gate) models only the backoff half of `ready_in` (the half property 5 is about) and
    the check lock `self._lock`; the bucket and the gap can only make `ready_in` larger. A refused
    read's penalty is at least 1 s (backoff_base is 60), applied with the fixed `penalize`.

  Since this model (re-verification, 2026-09-25): `penalize` caps the ladder's exponent at 30 (the same values
  for every base and cap in use, where 2 ** 1024 overflowed); the gate here has one host, and a page watch's
  model calls go to a second one, OpenRouter, so `_model_budget` also refuses a model call while OpenRouter's
  own hold is in force, and OpenRouter's refusals are charged to OpenRouter (`FetchError.host`).
