  The chief of staff's card machine (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/chief.py, chief_card.py, chief_ledger.py,
  chief_receipt.py, chief_desk.py, chief_reflect.py), written 2026-09-29 before the Python, from the chief
  design (sections 3.3, 4.1, 4.3 and 7) and its build addendum (owner decisions, Reflexion). This is new code
  meant to be right from the start, so the honest shape is `code_invariant`: the properties proved of the
  machine as specified, over every trace. There is no earlier buggy version to put a `current_violates` on.
  `naive_violates` is the positive control: the same machine with an oracle that trusts the executor's
  sentence closes a card as done with no evidence.

  The properties (design 9 P8, addendum "Reflexion"), conjoined in `Spec`:

    DoneNeedsEvidence       a card is done only on the owner's word, or when every done check is confirmed
                            and every confirmation rests on evidence the oracle saw outside the executor's
                            own sentence (design 2.4; plan_executor.py:20-25, "unverifiable is never success");
    OneYesOneAct            every one-way dispatch spends a distinct yes, given for that phase at the card's
                            revision at the time of the dispatch; a no, a hold word or a timeout is never a yes
                            (design 7.3; consent.py:50 `decision`);
    BudgetBeforeDispatch    what the card spent plus the ceiling held by its running phase never exceeds the
                            cap, up to what executors ran past their own ceilings (`over`, 0 when every
                            ceiling holds) (design 7.6);
    PushBudgetQuiet         an interrupting message (an unprompted push, or a reminder the owner asked for)
                            goes out now only outside quiet hours and at a breakpoint, an unprompted one only
                            with pushes on, at most 2 a day, and the day's count survives a restart; no Go is
                            asked and no act or one-way phase starts in quiet hours (design 4.3, 7.7; addendum 1);
    NoActReplayAfterRestart a one-way act in flight at a restart is never dispatched again without a yes given
                            after the restart (design 4.3 "Any restart", 7.13);
    OneWayNeverAutoRetried  a one-way phase's attempt count rises only with a fresh yes, and it is never
                            retried automatically; a two-way phase retries itself at most MAX_RETRIES = 2
                            times (3 trials) (addendum, Reflexion "Trials");
    LessonsBounded          at most OMEGA = 3 lessons per (executor, phase kind) key (addendum, Reflexion
                            "Episodic memory"; Shinn et al., NeurIPS 2023, arXiv:2303.11366, Omega = 1-3).

  Abstraction. One card, the desk it shares with every other card, and the lesson store. Cards share nothing
  else: every card event names its card id, and the budget, revision, approvals and checks are per card, so
  what is proved of one card holds of each card of many. The phase list and the number of done checks are
  fixed when take_on makes the card (`Plan`); a revision bumps `rev` and cancels every approval and every
  pending Go (design 7.3), and does not re-plan the phases here. A card runs one phase at a time (the
  research -> assess -> act chain of design 4.1; each phase reads the previous one's result), so
  `running` is at most one index. Budgets are two Nat counters per dimension (`usd`, `secs`), read the same way
  by the code; the replay test uses integer micro-dollars. Ceilings are a parameter (`ceil`), per phase kind
  (design 7.6: web read 90 s, Mac 10 min, the astra call); every theorem holds for every choice. The door
  floor (a regex over the goal) and the executor choice are outside: `Plan` carries each phase's door after the
  floor, and a door only ever rises (`raise`, add-only, only before the phase first ran). Which Mac floor runs
  an act (Codex forced) and the one Mac slot are unit-tested, not modelled. Time is the minute of the local day
  (`clock`, 0-1439) and the change of date (`newDay`); `start` is at minute 0, inside quiet hours, so a replay
  sends `clock` first. Quiet hours bar every one-way phase as well as every act (design 4.3 names acts only). A Reflexion call that errors writes no lesson and
  retries nothing: it is no event at all.

  Python names the replay test (bridge/tests/test_chief_lean.py) maps to. The design fixes the ledger's event
  kinds and the card and phase fields; where it names nothing (`attempts`, `retries`, the "I may have done"
  state) the name below is the one the replay should find, or bind to whatever P3 ships under it.

    Event (here)              Python
    ask n                     the Go for phase n goes out (`_ask_user(..., choices=YES_NO)`); ledger `asked`
                              {card, n, rev}; a Go the Desk holds back in quiet hours is no event here
    answer n .yes/.no/        the answer to that Go: a Yes tap / a No tap / 180 s of silence / a hold word
      .timeout/.hold          (ledger `answered` with answer "yes"|"no"|"timeout"|"hold"; `approved` on yes)
    goId n                    the code word "go c<N>" (ledger `approved`, via "id")
    revise                    `Ledger.revise(id, patch, why)` / Change (ledger `revised`, rev + 1)
    raise n                   a door raised to one_way before the phase ever ran (ledger `revised`)
    dispatch n                the chief starts phase n (ledger `dispatched`, written before the executor runs)
    result n good cost        `Chief.on_phase_result(card, n, result)`; good = result.status == "done";
                              cost = (result.usd, result.secs)
    reflect n key retry       chief_reflect: a lesson appended to lessons.jsonl under key (executor, phase kind)
                              (ledger `reflected`), and the phase re-queued (`retried`) as Trials allows
    requeue n                 Reopen on one finished phase
    restart cost              the daemon restarts: `Ledger(dir)` reloads, `Chief.run()` resumes; cost = the
                              spend rows tagged with the card for the run the restart killed
    happened n / didnt n      the "It happened" / "It didn't" buttons on "I may have done: ..."
    oracle i ev               `chief_receipt.check(done_checks[i], results)` (ledger `checked`): ev is what it

    close                     `chief_receipt.close(card)` after the last phase
    ownerDone                 "done c<N>", or "Yes, done" on an unverified receipt, or Done on a commitment
    reopen                    Reopen on the receipt (rev + 1, checks back to pending)
    drop                      "drop c<N>" / Drop
    raiseBudget k             the "Raise to $X?" tap

    lessons                   the keys of lessons.jsonl's lines, oldest first, each key a Nat here

  Ghost fields (`yeses`, `owActs`, `lastYes`, `stale`, `doubt`, `replay`, `over`, and S's `quietAct`,
  `badPush`, `sentToday`) have no Python field; the replay computes them from the ledger's events.
