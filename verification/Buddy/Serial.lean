Buddy.Serial — the host side of the serial link to the robot.

Three models, each of the code as it was (`…Cur`) and as fixed (`…Fix`):

  A. BuddySerial.send's write lock (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/serial_transport.py).
     Invariant: at most one `ser.write` runs on the port at any time.
  B. The status-ack watchdog (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/daemon.py, _status_poller
     and the status-ack branch of _handle_ble).
     Invariant: a link that flaps (never two consecutive answered watchdog polls
     between escalations) reaches the RTS pulse on every second escalation.
  C. Request/ack matching for the folder push (folder_push._send_expect,
     Daemon.wait_for_ack / expect_ack, the ack router in _handle_ble).
     Invariant: an ack is never dropped while its request is outstanding, and a
     waiter only ever receives the ack for its own request.

Core Lean only. Every theorem is closed by `decide`, `rfl`, `simp`, `omega` or
induction; nothing uses `native_decide`.

/-! ## A. Writes on the port

Senders are numbered. `lock` is `_send_lock`'s holder; `writes` lists the
senders whose `ser.write` is running on an executor thread right now.

  acq i     serial_transport.py:195   `async with self._send_lock:` acquires
  submit i  serial_transport.py:202   `run_in_executor(None, ser.write, data)`
  finish i  the executor thread's `ser.write` returns
  cancel i  the sending task is cancelled (daemon.py `_send_cam`:
            `asyncio.wait_for(self.ble.send(...), timeout=2.0)`)

Current code: a cancel while awaiting the executor raises CancelledError out of
the `await`, and `async with` releases the lock at once, while the thread is
still inside `ser.write`. -/

/-! ## C. Request/ack matching (folder push)

Request ids stand for (ack type, `n`): the firmware's chunk ack carries `n`,
the file's cumulative byte count (firmware xfer.h `_xAck("chunk", true,
_xWritten)`), which the host can predict.

  send k    folder_push._send_expect: `await daemon.ble.send(payload)`
  reg k     Daemon.wait_for_ack / expect_ack: `self._ack_waiters.append(...)`
  ack k     the board's ack for request k reaches the router in _handle_ble
  expire k  the waiter for k times out (`asyncio.wait_for`), request k gives up

Current code sends first and registers second (folder_push.py:134-137), and the
router hands an ack to the oldest waiter of the same TYPE (daemon.py:2551-2556). -/
