  Stopping a computer task from the Telegram chat (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/telegram.py).

  `_run_agent` awaits `agent.run(goal)`; once it returns, the task (an asyncio Task) is still not
  done: it awaits `_close_progress`, then the `_say` of the result, and maybe `_send_screen`. So
  `task_running` stays true for that whole tail. The property:

    if the agent's run returned a real result (no cancel reached it first), the owner receives that
    result and is never told "Stopped."; and a stop that did reach the running run says "Stopped."
    and the result (the agent's own "I stopped") is not sent as well.

  Abstraction. `ret` is `agent.run` returning. By the agent contract (FakeAgent, chrome_lane.py:128,
  app_reflex.py:323) a cancel that reaches a run before it returns makes it return its stopped
  result, so "completed" is "returned with no cancel before it". A cancel after the return is a
  no-op on the agent. The awaits of the tail are `step`s: `closing` is the `_close_progress` await,
  `delivering` the result's `_say` and the optional screen. `stop` is "stop" typed (`_handle`,
  telegram.py:1861-1866 before the fix, -> `_stop`); `toolStop` is the model's stop_task tool. The
  Stop button (`_stop_task`) checks `_task_progress is progress`, which `_run_agent` clears before
  its first await (telegram.py:3327 before the fix), so after the return it already reached nothing;
  before the return it is the same as `stop`.
