  The link and the note in a watch alert (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/watch.py `model_reading`, `evaluate`;
  telegram.py `tell_owner` -> `_say` -> telegram_format.compose). Line numbers are those of watch.py as reviewed
  (1792 lines, before the fix). An alert is texted as buddy's own message and goes into the chat's history as
  buddy's words (`tell_owner`, `_note("buddy", ...)`). The property:

    an alert for a page watch links only the page the owner gave; an alert for a search watch links only a
    link the search reading gave; and no alert carries a link hidden behind other words.

  How the code builds it. `model_reading` (:868-883) keeps a `url` from ANY model answer that starts with
  http(s) (:880-881), for the page-text reader and the screenshot reader too, whose prompts (PAGE_SYSTEM,
  VISION_SYSTEM) never ask for one; those readers see the page's own words and pixels. `evaluate` (:984-1059)
  stores it (`w.last_url`, :993-994) and links `w.last_url or w.target` (:1053). The note (whitespace
  collapsed, 200 characters, :879) is added for a search or ticketmaster watch or a page watched by search
  (:1054-1055), and telegram_format turns `[words](https://...)` into a hyperlink showing only the words.

  Abstraction. A watch is a `page` or a `search` watch. A reading comes from a `reader`: `structured` (the page's
  own markup; `structured()` never sets a url), `text` (the page-text model), `vision` (the screenshot model) or
  `search` (the web-search model). `read r u n f` is one reading from reader `r`; `u` says the answer holds a
  url, `n` that its note holds a markdown link, `f` that the reading makes the condition fire. The stored link is
  `none`, from the `search` reader, or from a `pageModel` (text or vision). The owner's own page is the target,
  linked when nothing is stored.

  The fix: `model_reading` keeps a url only for `source == "search"` and turns `[`/`]` in the note into `(`/`)`;
  `evaluate` links `w.target` for a page watch. It passes the Python replays. Bound: none. The step lemma is
  checked by `decide` on all 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 24 states and all 32 events; `fixed_invariant` then holds for every
  trace of any length, by induction.

  As implemented (re-verification, 2026-09-25): the note is made plain in `evaluate` (`plain_note`) for every
  kind that shows one, Ticketmaster included, whose event and presale names are Ticketmaster's words; this model's
  Kind has page and search only. A search's url is kept only when `_plain_link` finds nothing the formatter could
  read as markup (no brackets, parentheses, quotes, angle brackets, spaces), since a url itself can carry
  `[words](link)`.
