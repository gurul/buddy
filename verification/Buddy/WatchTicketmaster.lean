  The Ticketmaster watch (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/watch.py): `ticketmaster_reading` turns the Discovery
  API's events into a reading, and `evaluate` (condition "available") turns readings into texts.

  Ticketmaster's own status definitions (developer.ticketmaster.com, Discovery Feed, quoted in the
  function's docstring): onsale is within the public onsale timeframe; offsale is not yet reached or past it,
  and inventory may be available in an active presale; rescheduled is shown as on sale if there is
  inventory; postponed and canceled are not on sale. The properties, all proved for EVERY list of events
  and every `now` (no bound: they are proofs by induction, not an enumeration):

    1. `available_iff`: available iff some event is not canceled, not postponed, not an offsale event
       whose public sale has ended, and is onsale or rescheduled or has a presale window [start, end)
       holding now (a missing end is open-ended);
    2. `ended_is_invisible`: an offsale event whose public end has passed, put anywhere in the list,
       changes neither available, nor the dates listed, nor the dates on sale, nor the "Next:" note;
    3. `value_none_iff` / `value_some`: the value is None exactly when no event of the chosen pool
       (open events, else kept events, else all) has a positive price-range min; a value is always > 0
       (never 0) and the lowest positive min of the pool;
    4. `next_none_iff` / `next_is_earliest`: the "Next:" note names a sale start strictly after now, of a
       kept event, and none earlier exists among the kept events;
    5. over time, with `evaluate`: what the owner wants, decided here. A presale often needs a code the
       owner does not have; the public sale is the one anyone can use. So the owner wants to hear of each
       OPENING: a check that finds tickets buyable after one that found none. A presale, a gap, then the
       public sale is two texts; a presale that runs straight into the public sale is one (its text's note
       already says when the public sale opens). And each open stretch is told exactly once: by the add
       reply when that reply showed the sale open (evaluate's rule "the first reading never fires"), else
       by one text. `Spec` below is that last sentence.

  Found: the current code breaks 5 when the add reply showed NO reading. `add` keeps a watch whose first
  check failed ("the first check failed ...; I'll keep trying", watch.py:1664) or was queued (1647), with
  `checks == 0`. The next successful check from the loop is then "first" to `evaluate` (988, 1036-1037):
  it only arms, so a sale already open at that check is never texted, and the owner, who was never shown
  a reading, hears nothing until the sale closes and opens again (`current_violates`). The fix passes
  `shown` from `add` (1652, 1658) through `check` (1427, 1457) into `evaluate`, and only a shown first
  reading is quiet (`fixed_invariant`). Once the first reading was shown, current and fixed code are the
  same (`cur_eq_fix_after_shown`), and the texts are exactly the openings (`texts_are_openings`,
  `presale_gap_texts_twice`, `presale_into_public_texts_once`).

  Abstraction. Times are `Nat` (`_iso` gives float seconds; only `≤`/`<` against now and each other are
  used). A status code is one of six (anything not named is `other`; "cancelled" is `canceled`). A
  presale window is its start and end (a missing or unparsable time is `none`) and a name. A priceRanges
  entry is its `min` when it is a number, else `none`; Python's `min` over (value, currency) tuples is
  modelled by its value (the currency is ignored; the value is the smallest). `min(upcoming, key=...)`
  keeps the first of equal starts, as `earliest` does. The event's url, name and the note's words are
  not modelled. In Part 2 only successful checks are events: a failed check raises before `evaluate`
  (watch.py:1435-1451) and changes none of `checks`, `armed`, `last_available`. The one ticketmaster
  reading always has `available` set, so the `r.available is not None` guard is always true.
