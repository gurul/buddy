  Where "/watch <words>" goes in the Telegram inlet (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/telegram.py, `_handle`).

  "/watch AAPL below 300" is buddy's own command: the bot menu offers it (`BOT_COMMANDS`, "watch"), and
  `_handle` rewrites it to "Watch AAPL below 300" for the text brain, which holds the watch tools
  (telegram.py:1871-1875). Bare "/watch" is one of buddy's code words and is answered by code "relay or not"
  (1943-1944, 1962-1964, 1986-1990). The property:

    a "/watch <words>" request is never typed into the Claude session or sent to Codex; it is handled
    exactly as "buddy: watch <words>" is (the brain, or the answer to a question that takes any text).

  Abstraction. The relay is off, Claude (`self.claude`) or Codex (`self._codex_chat` is this chat); the two
  are exclusive (`codex on` clears `self.claude`, 1893-1897; `claude on` clears the Codex chat, 1912-1919).
  The question slot (`_pending_answer`, `_pending_strict`, `_pending_words`; see Questions.lean for the slot
  itself) holds one kind: none, `free` (a task's question: any text answers it), `choice` (a prompt with
  buttons from `_ask_user`: strict) or `perm` (`decide_permission`'s Allow/Deny: strict, and a permission).
  A message is `plain` words, `yes` (a bare yes/no or a button's word, `consent.bare_decision`), `bareWatch`
  ("/watch", in WATCH_WORDS), `watchCmd` ("/watch <words>") or `buddyPre` ("buddy: <words>", BUDDY_PREFIX).
  After the rewrite "Watch <words>" is not a yes/no and not a code word, so the current code routes it as
  `plain`. The other branches of `_handle` (launch tree, rundown, codex/claude commands, stop words, images)
  are not reached by these five messages and are left out.

  Bound: the step lemma is checked by `decide` on every one of the 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 states and 13 events
  (8 control events, `send` of each of the 5 messages); `fixed_invariant` then holds for every trace of any
  length, by induction. `fix_agrees` checks the fix changes nothing but "/watch <words>", on all 12 x 5
  (state, message) pairs.
