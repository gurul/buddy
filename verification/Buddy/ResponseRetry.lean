  The OpenAI seam's retry on a TLS drop (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/computer_agent.py,
  `make_response_creator` and `make_stream_creator`).

  On 2026-09-28 three phone-call turns died on a bare `ssl.SSLError`: a TLS read that fails after the
  handshake comes out of anyio unmapped, and the SDK neither wraps nor retries it. One drop killed the
  turn. The obvious cure, "always retry", is wrong on the streamed call: a sentence already read out to
  the owner would be read out again. On 2026-09-30 one retry was not enough either: it went out 120 ms
  later on the same connection pool and dropped again. The code now retries twice, each time after a
  pause and on a new client (the new-client part is tested in bridge/tests/test_response_creators.py;
  this model is about which tries happen). The properties:

    (1) a turn fails only because the connection dropped on all three tries, or dropped after text was
        read out;
    (2) no text is read out twice.

  Abstraction. `drop` is `ssl.SSLError` raised by the call; `text` is a delta handed to `on_text` (read
  out at once by the call's SentenceStream); `done` is the response completing. `attempt` is which try is
  running (a try starts only after a drop). `spokePrior` is text having been read out during an earlier
  try. `duplicated` is text read out in a later try after text was read out in an earlier one (the same
  reply, twice). `droppedEvery` (the drop that failed the turn came on the third try) and
  `droppedAfterText` are why a failure is allowed.
