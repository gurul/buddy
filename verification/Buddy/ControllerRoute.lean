  What the controller board is sent, and what it hands the daemon
  (bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/controller.py: `mirrored`, `Controller.mirror`, `Controller._replay`,
  `Controller._on_message`; and the tee `send_both` in `Daemon.__init__`, bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/daemon.py).

  The StackChan is the robot. A Home Assistant Voice PE next to it is the "controller": it takes input and
  shows state. `send_both` (daemon.py:137-142) sends every message for the robot to the robot, then passes it
  to `Controller.mirror`. `mirror` keeps the latest message of each mirrored kind in `self.last` and sends it
  at once when the controller is connected. `_replay` sends the kept state; `run` calls it on each connect,
  and the link calls it as `on_boot` when the board prints its boot line. A line from the controller reaches
  the daemon (`on_input`, which is `Daemon._handle_ble`) only when its cmd is in INPUT_CMDS =
  {ptt, key, focus, music}. Since 2026-09-27 the daemon also sends the controller alone the Voice PE's Spotify
  mode (music_mode.py) through `Controller.show`: `music_mode` (kept in `self.last` and replayed), `ring_level`
  and `music_flash` (sent only). `show` is called with nothing else: `MusicMode.send` and the daemon's put-back
  in `_handle_ble` are its only callers.

  The properties, over every trace of mirror(any message), connect, disconnect, boot and a controller
  line(any message):

    (P1) the controller is never sent {"cmd":"sound","on":true}. The owner's rule: beeps only on the StackChan.
    (P2) every line forwarded to the daemon is ptt, key, focus or music. So the controller's acks and status
         never reach the robot's ack waiters.

  The counterexample (commit 4ed166d). MIRRORED_CMDS was {"agent", "sound", "listen"} and `_replay` sent
  only `self.last.values()`. With the controller connected, `mirror({"cmd":"sound","on":true})` sent it to the
  controller (`current_violates`). A second trace: the sound-on is kept while disconnected and replayed on
  connect (`current_violates_on_connect`). The fix (6541fa3, the current file): sound is not mirrored, and
  `_replay` sends SILENT = {"cmd":"sound","on":false} first. P2 held in both versions; `fixed_invariant`
  proves P1 and P2 together for the fixed step.

  The pytest replays against the real class: `test_the_beeps_are_the_robots_alone` (P1: sound-on mirrored
  while connected is not sent, and the first message on connect is SILENT) and
  `test_input_reaches_the_daemon_and_acks_do_not` (P2), both in bridge/tests/test_controller.py.
  `test_controller_show_keeps_the_mode_only` (bridge/tests/test_music_mode.py) replays `display`: only
  `music_mode` is kept, and it is sent again on connect.

  Abstraction and deviations from the Python.
  - A message is its shape only: `sound on`, agent, listen, heartbeat (no "cmd", has "total"), time (no
    "cmd", has "time"), status, ptt, key, focus, ack ({"ack": ...}: no "cmd", no "total", no "time") and
    other (any other cmd). Payloads other than sound's `on` are dropped; they do not bear on P1 or P2.
  - `self.last` is a dict keyed by kind; the model has one slot per kind that `mirrored` admits in either
    version (agent, listen, sound, heartbeat, time). `_replay` sends the slots in a fixed order, not the
    dict's insertion order. P1 does not depend on order.
  - `boot` replays whether or not the model is connected. The link only fires `on_boot` on a boot line read
    from an open port (serial_transport.py:390-394), so this over-approximates the sends.
  - `connect` replays at any time, also when already connected. `run` replays only after
    `wait_connected` returns; this also over-approximates.
  - A send that raises is suppressed in the Python; the model counts every send as reaching the board,
    which is the worst case for P1.
  - `send_audio` (buddy's voice for the board's speaker, only {"cmd":"pcm"} and {"cmd":"pcm_flush"} from
    desk_call.BoardSpeaker) is not modelled: it sends no sound command.
  - `mirror` is only reached through `send_both`, so "every message the robot is sent" is the event
    `mirror m` for an arbitrary m.

  Bound: none on the trace. The step lemma is proved for every state and every event, and `fixed_invariant`
  follows by induction over an event list of any length.
