  The watcher's conditions: `evaluate(w, r)` in bridge/src/cc_buddy_bridge/watch.py:984-1060, and the
  state it keeps on the watch (`checks`, `armed`, `baseline`, `last_value`, `last_available`).

  The properties, over any sequence of readings (and restarts, see below):

   1. the first reading (`checks == 0`) never alerts, for any condition;
   2. below / above / available / appears are edge-triggered: an alert comes only on a reading where
      the condition holds, and between two alerts there is a reading that carried the field and on which
      the condition did NOT hold (it re-armed); a reading whose field is None neither alerts nor touches
      `armed`; and a re-armed condition that holds again always alerts;
   3. drop_pct / rise_pct: an alert comes exactly when the move from the baseline reaches the
      percentage, the baseline then becomes that reading, and otherwise it stays; once a reading has
      carried a price the baseline is never None; and a reading never raises;
   4. change: an alert exactly when the value differs from the last KNOWN value, or the availability
      differs from the last known availability, never on the first reading.

  Finding (a bug, shape (a)). In 3, the current code divides by the baseline BEFORE its `base > 0`
  guard (watch.py:1023-1024). A price of 0 is a legal reading (`_price` and `model_reading` keep any
  finite value >= 0), so a baseline of 0 is reachable two ways: a first priced reading of 0 (rise_pct
  or drop_pct), or a drop_pct alert on a drop to 0 (a 100% drop reaches any percentage < 100, which
  `validate` requires), which sets the baseline to 0. The next priced reading raises ZeroDivisionError
  out of `evaluate`, out of `Watcher.check` (watch.py:1457, only FetchError is caught) and out of
  `tick` (watch.py:1503): the watch's `next_at` is never advanced (watch.py:1460 is not reached) and
  the list is not saved, so it stays first in line and every later tick dies on it again: no other
  watch is checked. The baseline 0 was saved by the check that set it, so a restart does not clear it.
  The fix treats a baseline of 0 like no baseline: the reading becomes the baseline (watch.py:1019).

  Not a bug, and why the Spec says so (2). The literal "alerts <= false->true transitions of the
  condition over the readings that carry the field" FAILS on the current code: a first reading whose
  field is None leaves `armed` at its default True (the branch guard at 1007/1035/1044 skips it), so
  the first reading that carries the field and already holds alerts, with no false reading before it
  (`unknown_start_alerts`). This is the intended reading of the code, not a defect: `add` reports the
  first reading to the owner ("already holds", watch.py `met`), and when that first reading carried
  nothing the owner was told "no reading yet", so the first time the condition is known to hold is
  news (tickets found on sale after a search that could not tell). The exception is exact and
  one-shot: it happens only when no earlier reading carried the field, so at most once per watch
  (`freeUsed` below), and the property proved is "a known false reading, or no known reading at
  all, since the last alert". A reviewer who wants the literal form instead would arm from the first
  reading that carries the field; that is a product decision, recorded here, not a proof gap.

  Also checked (3): a first reading whose value is None, then a priced one: `w.baseline is None`
  (1019) makes that priced reading the baseline, with no alert. Such first readings do happen: a page
  whose structured data, text model and browser all find no price returns the reading anyway
  (`_read_page`), and a search reading's price can be null (`model_reading`).

  Restarts. `to_json` is `dataclasses.asdict` (every field), and `from_json` passes every field name
  back to the constructor (watch.py:921-938); JSON keeps floats, bools and None exactly. So a restart
  maps the state `evaluate` depends on (`checks`, `armed`, `baseline`, `last_value`,
  `last_available`) to itself; `restart` below is that round trip, written out field by field. The
  test file checks the round trip on the real class.

  Abstraction and bounds.
   * Edge conditions: a reading is abstracted to what the branch reads: the field is None, or present
     and the condition holds / fails (`r.value <= w.value` for below, `>=` for above, `r.available`,
     `r.hit`). `w.value` is never None for below/above (`validate` requires a positive mark). The
     state is finite, so the invariant is checked on every state and event by `decide`: no bound on
     the trace length.
   * drop/rise: prices are naturals (any size) and the percentage is a positive natural. The move is
     compared exactly (`reaches`, cross-multiplied in Int); for a positive base that is the Python
     `moved >= w.value` over the reals. Float rounding is not modelled (see the answer: an exact 10%
     drop from 3.00 to 2.70 computes 9.999999999999996 and does not fire). No bound on trace length.
   * change: values are naturals, so "differs by more than 1e-9" is `≠`. No bound on trace length.
   * The alert text, the currency, the link and `fired` are not modelled: only whether an alert is
     returned.

  Since this model (re-verification, 2026-09-25), two things the Python does that the model does not say:
  * Property 1 is about a first reading the owner was SHOWN (`evaluate(..., shown=True)`, as `add` reports it).
    A first reading the owner never saw (the add's own check failed or was queued; the loop calls `shown=False`)
    may fire an edge condition that already holds. That is WatchTicketmaster's fixed step, proved there.
  * The percentage test is `moved >= value - 1e-9` in the Python and exact here: a move within 1e-9 percentage
    points of the mark counts as reaching it (3.00 -> 2.70 is 9.999...% in floats). Deliberate, and the only
    extra alerts it adds are on moves that short of the mark.
  * A reading in another currency is a failed read in `check` before `evaluate` runs; `evaluate` itself sees it
    as a reading with no price, which is the modelled `none`.
