// BuddyService — the menu-bar app's power switch for buddy.
//
// buddy is the bridge daemon, a launchd agent (`cc-buddy-bridge install --service`
// writes ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.cc-buddy-bridge.daemon.plist) with
// KeepAlive on, so killing the process only respawns it. Turning buddy off means
// taking the agent out of launchd and marking it disabled, so it stays off across
// logins until it is turned back on; on is the reverse. The helper is not
// sandboxed, so it may run /bin/launchctl in the owner's GUI domain.
