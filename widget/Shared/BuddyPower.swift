// BuddyPower — buddy's power switch, shared between the card and the helper.
//
// The desktop card is sandboxed and cannot touch launchd, but it shares the
// App Group container with the menu-bar helper. So the card's button writes a
// request file there, the helper (which can run launchctl, see BuddyService)
// watches for it, does the work, and writes the resulting state back for the
// card to draw. Two small JSON files, newest timestamp wins:
//
//   power-request.json  { on: Bool, at: Date }   written by the card's button
//   power.json          { on, switchable, line, at }   written by the helper
//
// A request newer than the state is one the helper has not answered yet: the
// card shows it as "stopping…" / "starting…" until the helper writes a state
// stamped after it.
