# Gates: remembered Codex Computer Use permissions

Scope: Allow the owner to remember specific Computer Use grants, with matching and revocation that preserve Codex's permission requirements.

- [x] P1: Installed permission metadata and official documentation establish how a grant is scoped and remembered.
  EVIDENCE: Official Computer Use/managed config docs, generated McpServerElicitationRequestResponse schema, installed native policy wrapper and desktop approval card confirm response _meta.persist session/always, exact native app identity and managed restrictions. Real metadata-only Calculator probe observed both scopes and declined without altering grants.

- [x] P2: Owner-selected remembered grants apply only to the approved scope; unknown requests and one-time denials remain unapproved, and Codex owns grant persistence and Settings revocation.

- [x] P3: Adapter and Telegram regression checks pass and changed code passes lint.

- [x] P4: Documentation explains scopes and native revocation, and the running Buddy instance loads the change.
  EVIDENCE: README and Telegram/integration docs cover exact commands and Settings revocation. permission-smoke.json records one native Calculator approval with always and zero requests in a separate fresh session, both with UI value 4. Buddy restarted idle at 2026-09-22 19:54 PDT; status socket healthy, Codex ready and Telegram listening.
