"""Replays of the scheduler traces that verification/Buddy/WatchScheduler.lean found (watch.py's Watcher).

Each test drives one interleaving the Lean model names, with the real Watcher and fakes lent for the
network, so no test touches a service. The fetch runs off the loop (offload=True), exactly as in the
daemon, and a gate holds it mid-flight while the owner's tool call runs on the loop.
