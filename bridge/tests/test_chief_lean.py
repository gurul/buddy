"""The chief's Lean model (verification/Buddy/Chief.lean), replayed against the Python chief: gate G8.3 of the chief
design (2026-09-29), ``PYTEST tests/test_chief_lean.py && echo CHIEF_LEAN_REPLAY_OK``.

The model's decision rules are transliterated here one to one (``MPhase`` … ``step_with``, each citing its Lean
definition), with the constants read out of the .lean file itself, so a change to either side shows up as a
disagreement. The transliteration is first held to the model's own kernel-checked traces (``desk_job_closes``,
``timeout_is_no``, … ``no_act_at_night``): what Lean proved of the model, the transliteration must reproduce.

Then seeded random traces drive the real ``Chief`` (chief.py) with fakes the test controls: when each executor
answers and how (a web read with four links, a failed one; an options sheet, a reply that is not one; a Mac act
that saw "Order confirmed" on screen, one whose only claim is its own sentence, one that failed), the owner's
answers and code words (Yes, No, silence, a hold word, "go c1", change, drop, done, reopen, It happened, It
didn't, Raise), the clock (quiet-hour edges), and restarts (a new Chief on the same folder). Every ledger line the
code writes becomes the model's event, and after every move the two must agree:

- **dispatch**: the code starts a step exactly when the model's ``dispatch`` of the first unfinished phase would
  (canGo, fits, quiet hours), and it is the same step;
- **approval**: every yes the code records (by id or to a Go) the model's ``fGo`` / ``fAnswer`` also grants, and
  the token is there on both sides or on neither; every Go the code asks the model's ``fAsk`` allows;
- **proof**: every ``checked`` verdict equals ``verdictOf`` of the evidence the fakes actually produced (the test
  knows it: it wrote them), and the card's status (active, unverified, done, dropped), revision, running step,
  each phase's state, attempts and retries, and the lessons kept per (executor, phase kind) are equal;
- the model's ``Spec`` (all seven properties) holds after every event.

Positive control (design 9 P8): a variant of the code whose act adapter takes the executor's own sentence for a
screen state (``chief_receipt.from_agent`` patched) closes a card done on the executor's word; the replay finds the
disagreement at that check, and the same variant agrees instead with the model's ``naiveVerdict`` oracle, whose
end state breaks DoneNeedsEvidence, as ``naive_violates`` proves in Lean.

Where the model and the code differ in shape and not in the properties, the replay maps one onto the other and
says so here (checked 2026-09-29 in chief.py):

1. A failed one-way act: the model puts it back to waiting for a Go on an active card (Chief.lean ``fReflect``);
   the code leaves it failed, closes the card unverified at the next tick, and Reopen then asks a new Go
   (chief.py ``_advance``, ``reopen``). Both never run it again without a new yes. The replay lets a code
   ``failed`` one-way phase stand for a model ``queued`` one.
2. "go c1" on an act in doubt: the code approves it by id ("say go c1 to do it again", chief.py ``approve``); the
   model's ``fGo`` only approves a queued or asked phase, so the replay feeds it as It didn't, then go. The code
   keeps offering It happened / It didn't on that act until it runs again; the replay does not press them then.
3. A retry: the code also re-checks the budget before it re-queues (chief.py ``_reflect``); the model leaves that to
   ``dispatch``. The replay passes the reflection's word AND the model's own ``fits`` as ``reflect``'s ``retry``.
4. Spend: the model's ``result`` cost is what the code charged (the card's spend before and after, in whole
   micro-dollars and seconds, rounded up: the budget thresholds are whole numbers, so ``x <= T`` iff
   ``ceil(x) <= T``).
5. A change on an unverified card: ``Chief.change`` makes a new revision and keeps it unverified (chief_card.revise
   refuses only done or dropped cards); the model's ``revise`` changes only an active card. Nothing can be approved
   on an unverified card on either side; the replay compares revisions up to the count of such changes. No door
   calls ``Chief.change`` yet (the chat's "change c12" shows the card, telegram.py ``verb == "change"``); the
   replay drives it because the model has ``revise`` and the method is the chief's API for it.
6. The desk: the model's ``atBreak`` is realized by a breakpoint at the moment of the offer on a Desk reloaded from
   the same folder (so every offer also checks that the day's count survives a reload); ``busy`` and ``restart`` are
   the absence of one. With pushes off the model drops an unprompted message where the code batches it
   (``push_off``); in shadow the code logs a would-push only where pushes on would have sent one, and counts it
   against the day's budget, so it is stricter than the model's ``silent``. Neither ever sends it.

Not generated, each for a stated reason: a Mac act left running while the clock passes its 10-minute ceiling (the
code stops it and holds it in doubt, ``_overdue``; the model has no stop event); "reopen" on a dropped card (the
code allows the typed word, the model's ``reopen`` only takes done or unverified; the Reopen button only exists on
those); the model's ``raise`` (a door raised before a step first ran: the code raises one only through a change
that re-plans, and every act is already one-way by the door floor); and Reopen while a step of a closed card is
still marked running (see
``test_a_card_closed_during_a_web_step_then_reopened_moves_on``: found as a strict xfail, fixed in on_phase_result).
