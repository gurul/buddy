"""Replays of the counterexamples in verification/Buddy/Voice.lean against the real VoiceSession.

A: a backend `error` event ends the delegated response, so the face must leave "thinking" and a tool
   result's deferred response.create must go out (Lean trace `[delegation, error]`).
B: when handing the question to the backend or the voice raises, `_ask_user` must still release its
   question slot (Lean `B_current_violates`: note fails, the slot keeps the future).

Fakes only: the scripted Live connection and fake speaker from test_voice_agent.py.
