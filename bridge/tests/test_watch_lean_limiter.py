"""Replay tests for the Lean model verification/Buddy/WatchLimiter.lean (RateLimiter in watch.py).

Each test is one counterexample trace the model found, driven against the real code. The properties that held
(the bucket never over-issues, a take after ready_in == 0 never goes into debt, the penalty bounds) are pinned by
the passing tests at the end, so a later edit that breaks one of them is caught here too.
