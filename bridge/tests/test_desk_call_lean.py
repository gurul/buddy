"""Replays of the counterexamples in verification/Buddy/DeskCall.lean against the real code.

Each test is one trace from that file's ``current_violates`` theorem, driven through the real classes with fakes
(no board, no microphone, no OpenAI). Each failed on the code before its fix.

  P2  A phone call starts during a desk call (PhoneCalls._serve does not ask about the desk). When the desk call
      ends, its Call.run cleared the chat's one listener, which was the phone's: the rest of the phone call was
      texted, not spoken. The real TelegramInlet holds the listener here.
  P1  A tap on the board while the "listening" ring is still being sent: the release ran first, and the press
      then opened the Mac microphone with the button up. Nothing closed it until the call ended.
  P1  A release during a wake-word conversation was dropped with the press, so the microphone stayed open.
  P3  The desk call ended while the button was still held, and the wake word came back mid-hold.

Async tests use an explicit asyncio.run, the repo convention.
