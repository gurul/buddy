"""motion.py: the host half of the board's motion vocabulary.

The board is the authority on what is safe, so these tests are about the wire
shape and about the host telling the truth — not about enforcing limits. The
limits are tested where they live, in firmware/claude_pet_stackchan/host/
motion_test.cpp, against the same header the board runs.
