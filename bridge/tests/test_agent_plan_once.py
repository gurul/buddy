"""ComputerAgent planning once (CC_BUDDY_PLAN_EXEC): one planner call, then the worker walks the plan.

The planner is test_computer_agent's FakeClient, which counts every request, so "one planner call and none at
the end" is a number the test reads. The worker is its FakeWorker plus `outline` and `run_plan`.
