"""The chief of staff: takes on the owner's jobs and commitments as cards, runs their phases, proves them done.

The owner asked for it on 2026-09-29 (the chief design, "intent-first", and its build addendum). This module is
the chief itself: its two chat tools, the dispatcher that runs a card's phases through buddy's existing
executors, the loop that wakes for them, and the owner's code words. The record is chief_card.py and
chief_ledger.py, the proof chief_receipt.py, the attention gate chief_desk.py, and the lessons chief_reflect.py.

One job, end to end (design 4.1):

1. **Capture.** The brain calls ``take_on`` inside the turn it is already taking. Code parses the card strictly
   (chief_card.parse: one bad field refuses the whole card), sets each phase's door, files it (chief_ledger) and
   returns the backbrief, composed by code, for the turn to send: the turn ends there with no second model call
   (the start_task rule, telegram.py:3412-3417). The owner's words (``said``) are used for the door's
   ``grounded`` and dropped: no line here, in the events or in a spend row, carries them.
2. **Phases run in order**, one at a time, each through the executor the code table picks (``EXECUTORS``):
   ``research`` on the web through search_router.answer(reader=True), called as web_reader calls it
   (web_reader.py:302-325) and counted against its daily reads, or on the Mac with a read-only goal when
   browser_router does not say web; ``assess`` as one astra call with a strict schema whose pick may cite only a
   page the research read; ``act`` on the Mac through the task seam, always one-way (chief_card.ACT_CANNOT_ASK)
   and always on ``floor="codex"`` (Codex alone, no reflex or other body); ``watch`` through
   Watcher.add (watch.py:2704).
3. **Budget before dispatch.** A phase starts only if what the card spent plus the phase's ceiling
   (``CEILINGS``: a web read 90 s, the Mac 10 min, the astra call) stays within the card's budget. Otherwise the
   card waits with "Raise to $X?" and nothing is dispatched. A phase is given up at its ceiling, never later: a
   step run here is abandoned then, and a Mac step is stopped (``stop_task``); a one-way act stopped that way may
   have happened, so it waits on the owner as after a restart. One line warns at 80%: unprompted, so the desk
   holds it (chief_desk ``warn``).
4. **One yes, one act.** A one-way phase runs only with the owner's yes for that phase at the card's current
   revision: a single-use token (``Approval``), spent by its dispatch, cancelled by any revision, and bound to a
   digest of the act as the Go showed it (``act_digest``: the goal, the pick, the limits, the notes), so a yes
   never runs an act that changed after it was given. A Yes to a question is for that question's phase only, and
   only while that phase has not run since it was asked. Only a reply that is wholly a yes approves
   (consent.bare_decision): a No, a hold word, a sentence that opens with "ok", silence or an error is never a
   yes. "go c<N>" approves by id. The dispatch re-checks all of it under the
   ledger's lock (Ledger.claim), against the card as it is then, never a copy read before an await.
5. **Quiet hours** (chief_desk) bar every act and every one-way phase, and hold every Go question.
6. **Events before acts.** ``dispatched`` is written (and fsynced) before an executor starts; a line that does
   not reach the disk means the act does not happen.
7. **Proof.** When no phase is left the card closes through the oracles (chief_receipt.close): ``done`` only
   when every check is confirmed, else ``unverified``, and the receipt, composed from the verdicts, goes out.
8. **Reflexion** (chief_reflect.py, Shinn et al. 2023). After each result the phase's own checks are read; a
   failed or unverifiable check, a failed or over-budget result, or a looping executor asks one cheap reflection
   for a lesson. A two-way phase may then run again (at most 2 retries, within budget) carrying the lessons in a
   delimited notes field; a one-way act never runs again by itself, carries only its own phase's lessons, and
   its next Go shows every one it carries. While a reflection is out the card does not move, and a retry clears
   any yes given for a later step.

The reviewer's attacks after P3 (2026-09-29) each became a failing test first (tests/test_chief.py, "attack"):
a Yes to an old question approved the next act; a drop or change made during another card's send still
dispatched the old yes; a yes survived a retry of the step that made the pick; lessons from other cards reached
an approved act unseen; a web read ran to twice its ceiling and a Mac step had none; a failed step closed done;
the budget warning and problems with the ledger skipped quiet hours; a batched "Raise to $X?" was lost.

The reviewer's attacks after P4 (2026-09-29), the same way (tests/test_chief.py and test_telegram_chief.py,
"attack"): a sentence opening with "ok" answered a waiting Go and ran the act; an act whose verb the pattern
missed ran with no Go; Codex's returned failure sentence closed a card done; "It happened" and "It
didn't" acted on an act that was running again; "I may have done" went out at 03:00; a card at its cap still paid
for a reflection. An act with no screen seen is now ``handed_on``, never done (chief_receipt.from_agent).

A commitment ("remind me Thursday to export the BOM") has no phases: its cue becomes a reminder the owner asked
for, which the desk sends at a breakpoint outside quiet hours and does not count against the daily budget. A
follow-up is an unprompted nudge, and only a firm commitment due within 2 hours may nudge (chief_desk).

**Resume** (design 4.3 "Any restart", rule 13). The ledger reloads; a read-only phase that was running runs
again; an act with a ``dispatched`` line and no ``result`` never runs again without a new yes: the card waits,
and the owner gets "I may have done: <act>. Check?" (``happened`` / ``didnt``). What the card spent is read back
from the spend rows tagged with its id (spend.job).

**The switch.** ``CC_BUDDY_CHIEF`` = auto (the default) | on | off. auto is on only when ``SHIPPED`` is True, and
``SHIPPED`` becomes True only when the E1 capture eval passes its pre-registered bar on a blind set scored once
(design 5.2 E1). It was scored once on 2026-09-29 and passed (the numbers are beside ``SHIPPED``), so auto is on;
``off`` still turns it off.

Everything the executors touch is lent (``research``, ``start_task``, ``watch``, ``create``, ``ask``,
``notify``), so the tests run the whole lifecycle with fakes; ``make_chief`` builds the real ones. The loop has
Watcher.run's shape (watch.py:2525-2542): tick, sleep until the next due time (at most 300 s), wake early.
