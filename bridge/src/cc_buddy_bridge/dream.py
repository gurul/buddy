"""The nightly dream: once a day, buddy rereads what was said and fixes what it knows.

The owner asked for it on 2026-09-23: "dream every night as well so that memories
can be fixed and updated". Until then a fact reached the records only through a
chain of per-conversation distils, a curate pass and a reconcile loop, and a
wrong fact stayed wrong until the owner edited the file by hand. Memory is now
three stores (owner, 2026-09-23): the transcripts hold every word, the records
hold what is true, mem0 finds things by meaning. The dream is the one step that
turns the first into the other two.

### What one night is

For one transcript day, in a worker thread, never on the event loop:

1. ``records.reconcile_day`` — ONE model call reads the current records, the
   profile, the owner's stars and the whole day's transcript, and returns the
   records that change, a new profile, and a journal (``days/<day>.md``). Where
   the day contradicts a record, the record gets a dated correction. That is the
   "fixed and updated".
2. ``records.consolidate`` — ONE model call over all records merges two ids for
   the same thing and ages out a fact a newer one replaced.
3. ``index.ingest_day`` + ``index.tidy`` — the day's conversations go into mem0,
   and exact duplicates and ★ candidates come out.
4. The day goes into ``records/.dreamt`` (one day per line) and a ``## Dream``
   section with the counts is appended to the journal, then committed, so every
   night ends with its whole journal in the records' history.

### Why the dream is the only automatic writer of records

The records keep one rule from their first day (2026-09-20): the brains read,
they never write. A model that promotes its own mid-conversation conclusions into
what it "knows" launders a guess into a fact. So nothing that talks writes a
record. The owner's own "remember that" goes to ``starred.md``, and the dream —
reading the owner's actual words, a day later, with the current records as input
so hand edits survive — is the only thing that changes a record by itself.

### Why after 04:00, and why at 04:30

A transcript day ends at 04:00, not midnight, so a conversation at 01:00 belongs
to the evening it continued. A night is dreamt only once its day is over: never
the current transcript day. The just-ended day waits until 04:30 local time
(``DREAM_HOUR``), half an hour past the rollover, so a conversation that ran over
04:00 has closed. Older nights are due at any time: that is the catch-up after
the Mac slept through 04:30. Catch-up runs oldest first, at most
``MAX_NIGHTS_PER_WAKE`` a wake, so a week away does not become one long burst of
model calls.

### Failure is silence

The dream never breaks a conversation and never raises out of ``loop``. When the
reconcile call fails, nothing is written and the night is not marked: the next
wake tries again, and the warning is logged once per night. A night that fails
``MAX_TRIES`` times in one run of the daemon is set aside until the next start,
so one bad night cannot hold up the nights after it. When consolidate or the
index fails, the night is still marked: both are retried by the next night's
dream anyway (consolidate reads all records; the index ingests each conversation
it has not seen). A day with nothing said is marked with no model call. Logs
carry days, counts and seconds, never a word that was said.
