"""What buddy carries from one conversation into the next: where memory lives, and the opening brief.

buddy already remembers what it SEES: diary.py keeps a memory stream of looks. It remembered nothing of
what was SAID, and every conversation opened from nothing (owner request 2026-09-11). This module is the
cheapest part of the fix: the place memory lives on disk, and the one clause a conversation opens with.

### Where the memory lives

One folder, ``~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/memory`` (``CC_BUDDY_MEMORY_DIR`` overrides). The owner asked for
fewer stores (owner, 2026-09-23: "simplify the memory system — too many stores"), so there are three and an
archive, each a property of ``RecallConfig``:

    transcripts/   every word, written the moment it is said (transcripts.py): the source
    records/       what is true about the owner, rewritten nightly by the dream (records.py, dream.py)
    mem0/          a search by meaning, rebuilt from the transcripts (mem0_memory.py)
    archive/       the retired debrief store, moved here once (memory.migrate), read-only, still searched

The retired store's own location is still read, once, as the source of that move:
``CC_BUDDY_DEBRIEF_DIR`` or ``~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/debrief`` (``legacy_store``), and the old mem0
home ``~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/mem0`` (``legacy_mem0``).

### Why the opening brief does not search

A conversation opens on a recency question, and similarity has no clock (measured 2026-09-11: asked "what
did we talk about yesterday", a semantic search returned a note about opening lines). So the brief reads
the newest things only: when the transcripts last saw a word said, and, when that was before today, the
title of the dream's journal for that day. Search is left to the ``memory_search`` tool, mid-conversation.

### The two rules that keep it from being creepy

1. **At most one clause.** ``opening_brief`` returns one short sentence or nothing. A robot that recites a
   dossier at you is worse company than one that forgot.
2. **What buddy said is quotable; what buddy saw is not.** This module reads only the spoken memory.

Silence is a valid answer, and it is the right one with memory off and on the first ever conversation: the
brief is "", the instructions are byte-identical to a memory-less session, and buddy greets exactly as it
always did. It never announces that it has no memories.
