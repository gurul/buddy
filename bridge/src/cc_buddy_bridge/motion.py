"""Named motions the board runs by itself.

buddy used to move by being told one absolute pose at a time. A dance is a
sequence, so a rhythm cost a model round trip per beat and came out stepped. The
measurement that started this: median 2.3 s from the owner's words to the head
moving, and the delegated model call was 1.86 s of it — five times everything
else combined (log study, 2026-09-11).

So the vocabulary moved onto the board. One JSON line names a rhythm and the
firmware runs it locally at its own tween rate (`motion.h`, `body.cpp`), which
means a whole dance costs one line instead of one line per beat, and the beats are
generated 25 times a second instead of arriving over USB.

    {"cmd":"move","kind":"osc","yaw_amp":25,"pitch_amp":12,"period_ms":900,
     "phase_deg":90,"cycles":8,"dwell_pct":8,"jitter_pct":10}

### Who decides what is safe

**The board does, and this module is only friendly.** Every number is passed
through `motion::admit()` on the firmware before a servo sees it: amplitude
shrinks to fit the travel left about the centre, the per-axis velocity budget and
the bout cap, and cycles are shed rather than beats shortened. A host bug, or a
model asking for 120 degrees at 10 Hz, gets something safe rather than obeyed —
verified against the shipped header, where that request comes back as 15 degrees
at 1.5 Hz.

The presets here are checked against the same header, so what this module
predicts is what the board runs. `dance` asks for 25 degrees rather than the 28
it once did, because 28 is what the board reduces it to.

### Amplitude yields, never the beat

When the owner asks for a faster dance, the rhythm is the salient thing. Speeding
a motion up shortens the period and the board then narrows the swing to stay
inside the velocity budget. A faster dance is a tighter dance, not a refused one.
