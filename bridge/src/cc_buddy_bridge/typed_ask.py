"""Asking laya and Jev in their own idiom.

Both speak the same wire format — `predict(state, questions)` with `choice`, `score` and `noul`
questions — and for a day this project treated that as meaning they are the same thing: one
sixteen-option question, the same long option texts, the same 0.80 cut-off. Scored that way
(2026-09-21, 110 head-move utterances) laya looked useless (16.7%) and Jev merely good. They are
different machines, and each has a documented shape:

LAYA (laya-multilingual via laya-mlx: an mmBERT-base ENCODER with decision heads; nothing is
generated; 8–10 ms; nothing leaves the Mac)
  - The whole question — instructions plus every option — lives in a 256-token head, each option
    capped at 48 tokens and ALL of them cut once they overflow. Upstream: "77 options receive only
    ~3 to 4 tokens per label"; it degrades past about twenty. So: few options, one or two words each.
  - A choice is a RANKING of the options against each other, and that is what it is good at: asked
    "left / right / up / down / center" it answers at p = 1.00. Its absolute `noul` is its weak
    primitive — upstream: "over-confident as shipped", and the multilingual checkpoint "ships with no
    fitted temperatures at all"; here it says ≈ 0.1 for a plain yes. So a gate is asked as a choice
    too ("head / screen / search / object / talk"), never as a yes/no.
  - It reads a short English sentence well and a long state badly (~320 tokens of state upstream).
    The state is the utterance and nothing else.
  - Its probabilities are not calibrated, so no threshold is carried over from anywhere: each
    question's cut-off is fitted on a calibration half and reported on the other half.
  - It decomposes: three 3–7-way questions in ONE predict call cost the same ~10 ms.

JEV (TypeSafe's hosted System One, jev.py: 200–400 ms, the state leaves the Mac)
  - It is a LITERAL reader (TypeSafe: "It can be quite literal in its understanding"), weak at
    indirection, counting and dates, and it suffers "context rot" in a large irrelevant state. So the
    instruction says exactly what counts and what does not, in plain words, and the state is small
    and structured.
  - "A Choice is relative … each Noul is absolute and can be low for all of them." Its noul is
    excellent (0.94 for a head command, 0.04 for "scroll down a bit") and its choice alone is NOT a
    gate (it answers "down" for the scroll). So every Jev decision here is an absolute noul gate PLUS
    the relative choices, in one request — "every question is evaluated in parallel … adding
    questions barely changes the response time".
  - Thresholds are per question type ("Don't carry a threshold tuned on a Noul over to a Choice")
    and per consequence (TypeSafe's confidence-routing recipe), so they are fitted per question too.

The two askers below share nothing but the return type. That is the point.

# say what counts and what does not, a small structured state. Code decides; Jev only judges.
