"""The voice gate: in a conversation, only the person who said "hey buddy" reaches the model.

buddy's live voice is OpenAI's Live API (gpt-live-1), which has no turn detection, noise reduction or
speaker setting a client can touch: it hears whatever the client appends. So a TV, a call or someone else in
the room were answered, kept the conversation open (any transcribed speech resets the idle timer) and wiped
buddy's caption mid-reply (any transcribed speech is a barge-in). Whatever isolates a speaker has to happen
here, on the Mac, before `input_audio.append`.

HOW. The last seconds of microphone audio before the wake word are kept in RAM (ears.py), so the wake
utterance is an enrolment sample. Speech is cut into segments by energy; each segment's first HOLD of audio is
held back, embedded with a speaker-embedding model (sherpa-onnx, already a dependency — TitaNet-small, 192
numbers, ~10 ms on this Mac) and compared with the enrolled voice by cosine. A match is forwarded — the held
audio in one burst, then live; anything else is forwarded as SILENCE of the same length, because the Live
model wants a continuous stream and needs trailing quiet to close a turn. Non-speech blocks pass untouched.

    SEED         the wake utterance, trimmed to its speech. Never overwritten.
    PROVISIONAL  until ENROL_MIN seconds are enrolled NOTHING IS REJECTED. "hey buddy" is ~0.7 s, and a voice
                 embedding of that is not evidence: replayed on sherpa-onnx's sample speakers, one speaker's own
                 later speech scored 0.06–0.26 against his 0.6 s seed and most of it was silenced. So the
                 speech that starts within FIRST_TURN of the wake — the owner's query, by construction — is
                 forwarded and enrolled whatever it scores; later speech is forwarded too, and enrolled only
                 when it already resembles the voice so far (T_LOOSE).
    LOCKED       ≥ ENROL_MIN seconds enrolled: a segment is forwarded when its cosine clears T_ACCEPT,
                 re-scored as it goes on. This is the only state that silences anything.
    ADAPT        only a segment close to the centroid AND to the seed moves the centroid: a TV cannot walk it.
    RESET        at the end of the conversation everything is dropped. Nothing about a voice touches the disk.

IT FAILS OPEN, except where it is sure. No model file, an embedder that raised, no usable seed, a segment too
short to judge, nothing accepted at all since the wake (the enrolment itself is suspect): all of those forward
the audio as today. It closes only on a confident mismatch — which is the TV and the other person, the long,
plainly different segments. A robot that stops hearing its owner cannot be debugged by talking to it.

ONLY FOR QUERIES. In a think-aloud lesson buddy is a listener taking notes on whoever is speaking, so the
session sets `bypass` and every block passes unjudged. A conversation opened without a wake word (the lesson
toggle) has no seed, so it is ungated too.

THE NUMBERS BELOW ARE NOT FITTED. They come from a three-speaker probe on sherpa-onnx's sample recordings
(2026-09-21: TitaNet-small separated 3 s enrolments from 2 s tests cleanly, lowest same-speaker cosine 0.58,
highest different-speaker 0.39; two other popular models did not separate at all). That is why the switch
ships `off`, why `shadow` exists — every decision computed and logged, no audio changed — and why
tools/voice_gate_eval.py scores a labelled set of the owner's own room before anything is believed.
