"""Keep one Codex computer agent warm, so a hard task's handoff starts the turn at once.

A cold ``CodexComputerAgent.run`` spends 4.8-7.0 s (measured 2026-09-23) before the goal is used at
all: the app-server process, ``initialize``, an ephemeral thread, and the check that Computer Use's
``cua_repl`` tool is there. None of that depends on the goal, so ``WarmCodex`` does it ahead of time
(``CodexComputerAgent.prewarm``) and hands the ready agent to the next task that needs Codex.

* One warm agent at most, and it is single-use: the task closes it, as a cold one is closed.
* The next one is warmed after a task ends (``kick``), not while it runs: two app-servers never
  share the desktop during a task.
* A warm agent older than ``CC_BUDDY_CODEX_WARM_SECS`` (default 900), or whose app-server died, is
  thrown away and replaced by the refresh loop; ``take`` never hands out a stale one — the task then
  starts cold, exactly as before this module.
* ``CC_BUDDY_CODEX_PREWARM=0`` turns it off. A warm-up that fails is logged and retried on the next
  refresh; it never touches a task.
