"""buddy keeps its eyes on whoever is talking to it — and works out where they went when it loses them.

The Mac already finds every face in every camera frame (vision.py) and tells the board where the
largest one is. What the board does with that is its own policy (gaze.cpp): it live-tracks the
OWNER, in its attention and dictation states. In a voice conversation it goes to one fixed
"facing you" pose and stays there; a face that is not the owner's gets a single glance in the
calm states and nothing more. So a guest talking to buddy is never followed, and neither is the
owner once the conversation has opened — lean back, stand up, walk round the desk, and buddy
keeps addressing the chair.

This module is the policy for a conversation, on the host, with no reflash: the firmware accepts a
host pose in any state while a conversation is open, and "a host look owns the head from the
moment it lands until its hold runs out" (hostlook.h).

IT FOLLOWS A PERSON, NOT A SIGHTING. The first version turned toward every face box it was handed,
and on a real face (2026-09-21) it swung ±20° around someone sitting still. The offsets logged with
each move showed why: a frame reaches this code about half a second after it was taken (JPEG on the
board, 115200 baud, a Vision request), so "0.6 s after the move" was still a picture from mid-swing,
stamped with a pose the head had already left. So there is a track:

- a position and a VELOCITY in absolute head angles, averaged over sightings;
- nothing is evidence for SETTLE_SECS after a move, which covers the glide AND that pipeline delay;
- a sighting has to AGREE with where the track says the person should be (AGREE_DEG) before the head
  acts on it; one that does not is an outlier until a second one says the same, and then it is the
  truth (they really did jump, or it is someone else);
- moves are limited to MAX_STEP_DEG, led slightly by the velocity (LEAD_SECS) so a walking person is
  met rather than chased, inside a deadband, with the hold renewed while the face sits still.

WHEN IT LOSES THEM IT REASONS, IN THIS ORDER, from what it knew a moment ago and what it has learned:

1. WHERE THEY WERE HEADING. If the last sightings were moving (SPEED_FAST deg/s), or the face left by a
   frame edge, it looks further the same way — one field-of-view step, then another. Someone who
   leaves quickly is followed at once (LEAVING_HOLD_SECS), not after the ordinary patience.
2. WHERE THEY USUALLY ARE. A PresenceMap — a decayed histogram of the absolute angles at which faces
   have been followed, kept in ~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/presence.json across restarts — gives the two
   likeliest places that have not just been tried. At a desk that is "the chair" and "standing".
3. EITHER SIDE of where they were, one field-of-view step: at a desk people shift sideways more than
   anything else, and this is what finds them before the map has learned anything.
4. UP AND DOWN at the last heading: they stood up, or sat back.
Then it gives the head back, and it does NOT search again until it has really seen someone again: one
search per loss, at most MAX_SEARCHES a conversation. The first live run (2026-09-21) searched three
times back to back at an empty chair, which is how an anxious robot behaves.

IT USES WHAT THE DAEMON KNOWS:
- WHO IS TALKING, from the conversation's phase: it follows in `wake`, `listening`, `asking` and
  `speaking`; in `thinking` (the glance aside) and `working` (head down at the desk) it hands the head
  back at once, so buddy keeps its own expressions.
- WHICH FACE: with several, the one nearest the track, so a passer-by does not steal the gaze.
- WHAT THE OWNER ASKED FOR: "look left", look_around and find own the head for as long as they hold it.
  An explore, the dictation key and a lesson's listening pose own it too (`blocked`).

WHEN A CONVERSATION OPENS AND NOBODY IS IN VIEW, it does not wait at the board's fixed pose hoping. On
2026-09-21 the owner sat 23° to buddy's left and a little below level, and from the fixed pose his face
was in a quarter of the frames, mostly at the edge. After ACQUIRE_AFTER_SECS with no confirmed face it
looks, once, at the place the map says people most often are, and follows from there.

AND IT TELLS THE MEMORY BUS. Every change — seen, lost, found and how — is published on
`/buddy/presence`, so rosbridge clients (Foxglove, `cc-buddy-bridge memory tail`) see buddy's sense of
where its person is, live. The control loop itself reads the local map, never the bus or claude-mem:
a head cannot wait on an HTTP recall. Nothing here identifies anyone; the map holds angles, not faces.
