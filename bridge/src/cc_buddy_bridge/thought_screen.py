"""What earns a place on the robot's own screen.

The diary writes down a great deal (diary.py): that is what a memory is for,
and a record nobody reads costs nothing. A screen is the opposite. buddy sits
on a desk all day in someone's peripheral vision, and every line it puts up is
a small claim on their attention. Two thoughts that say nearly the same thing
are worth keeping and not worth showing twice.

So the screen has its own gate, stricter than the memory's and independent of
it. The rules, and where the numbers come from:

* **A floor on the thought itself.** Importance >= 6, novelty >= 7, or a cool
  score >= 0.70. Deliberately *not* "the diary wrote it": the diary's write
  gate also fires after three hours of silence, which writes thoughts that are
  dull by construction, and frequent low-importance messages are the strongest
  predictor of a person muting a source outright (Sahami Shirazi et al., *Large-
  scale assessment of mobile notifications*, CHI 2014).
* **The subject veto, which does the real work.** A different sentence about
  the same vent is still the vent. Tags overlapping a recent caption by
  ``SUBJECT_OVERLAP`` inside ``SUBJECT_WINDOW_SECS`` are refused. This is the
  load-bearing rule: measured on buddy's own repetitive pairs, no surface
  similarity measure separates them at any threshold anyone ships — "the vent
  is still there" against "the vent is annoyingly centered today" scores 0.25
  content-word Jaccard, far under the 0.7-0.85 that de-duplication pipelines
  use. Only the subject tells them apart.
* **A phrase veto and a similarity backstop**, for literal restatement that the
  subject rule would miss because the tags happened to differ.
* **Silence between captions.** ``MIN_INTERVAL_SECS`` and ``PER_HOUR``: the
  cost of an interruption accrues over about twenty minutes and does not depend
  on how relevant the interruption was (Mark, Gudith & Klocke, *The cost of
  interrupted work*, CHI 2008), so the rate is capped and nothing can buy an
  extra turn.
* **A returning subject gets fewer turns each time.** Beyond
  ``TOPIC_LIMIT`` showings inside ``TOPIC_WINDOW_SECS`` a subject is done for
  the day, however it is phrased.

Ubiquitous tags are stripped before any of this: on a desk robot nearly every
frame contains "desk" or "ceiling", and a tag that appears in everything
identifies nothing.

A refused thought is dropped, not queued. By the time the screen frees up
buddy is looking somewhere else, and a stale caption is worse than none.

Pure: no clock of its own, no I/O. The daemon calls ``offer`` with the
monotonic time it already has.
