"""Head: buddy turns its head when the owner asks — to any described pose, not a fixed menu.

The voice's backend model reads "look a bit up and to your left", "turn all the
way round", "look at the door" and picks the numbers; this module owns the
geometry and the wire. One absolute frame, robot-centred, the same one the
firmware uses:

    yaw    0 = straight ahead (toward the owner at the desk)
           + = the robot's own RIGHT, - = the robot's own LEFT   (body.cpp, bench-verified 2026-09-05)
           ±120 = as far as the neck turns: "behind you" is the nearest of the two
    pitch  45 = level, 5 = all the way down at the desk, 85 = up at the ceiling

The owner faces the robot, so "my left" is the robot's right. The backend
prompt says so; this module only ever speaks the robot's frame.

Poses go out as ``{"cmd":"look","yaw","pitch","hold"}``. The board echoes its
real pose on every camera frame (``"yaw"``/``"pitch"``), which ``observe``
records, so a relative move ("a bit more left") starts from where the head
actually is, not from where it was last told to go.

``look_around`` and ``find`` combine the head with scene.py: turn, let the
image settle, then describe (or search) a frame taken after the turn — a view
from before the move is never reported as the view at the new pose.
