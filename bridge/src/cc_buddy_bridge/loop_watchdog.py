"""A watchdog for the daemon's event loop.

Every stall of the loop looks the same from the outside: the log goes quiet, the
robot sits still, then everything that queued up lands in one burst. The 2026-09-21
wake-word stall (heard 'hey buddy' → 19 s of nothing → "Yeah?") and the 41 s
hang right after the serial port opened both had that shape, and the log could not
say which call held the loop, because the loop is what writes the log.

So a thread watches the loop from outside. The loop pets the watchdog every
quarter second with `call_later`; when the pets stop for longer than `threshold`,
the thread logs the loop thread's Python stack at WARNING — the one fact a stall
leaves nowhere else — and again every `repeat` seconds while it lasts. When the
loop comes back it logs how long it was gone.

`faulthandler` is registered on SIGUSR1 as well, for a stall this thread cannot
see (the GIL held by a C call): `kill -USR1 <pid>` dumps every thread to stderr,
which launchd points at the daemon log.
