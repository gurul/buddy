"""Meet: buddy joins a Google Meet call, listens, and texts the owner the notes.

The owner says ``/meet <link>`` on Telegram, "join my 3pm" in the chat, or "join my meeting" out loud. Buddy
opens a tab of its own in the owner's Chrome (attach mode, so the owner's Google account and its meetings),
turns the microphone and the camera off, presses Join, reads Meet's live captions with the speakers' names,
and when the call ends — or the owner says leave — writes the notes under ``transcripts/meetings/<date>/``
and texts a summary.

### Listen only, for good

The owner chose a notetaker that never speaks (2026-09-25). So there is no audio path out at all, and the page
script (``meet_page.js``) can click only a short list of safe controls: microphone off, camera off, continue
without a microphone, Join now / Ask to join / Join here too, captions on, and Leave. It presses Join only once
it has SEEN both the microphone and the camera off, and in the call it turns either off again if it comes on.
The tab is kept quiet too: the call is not played out loud on the Mac, where the robot's own microphone is.

### The owner's account, twice

The owner may be in the same call from another computer with the same Google account. Meet then offers
"Join here too" and "Switch here". Buddy presses only Join here too: Switch here moves the call to buddy's tab
and drops the owner's own device.

### Captions, not audio

Meet's captions carry who said what, cost nothing, and need no audio device. The page only records what the
caption region shows (a snapshot per change); ``CaptionMerger`` here turns those snapshots into lines. That is
the hard part and it is plain Python, so it is tested without a browser: Meet shows a sliding window of a few
lines per speaker, revises the last words as it hears more, and re-renders the block now and then.

The transcript is appended to the notes file as lines settle, so a crash mid-call keeps what was heard.

The page script is a port of OpenClaw's google-meet plugin (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 OpenClaw Foundation).

SUMMARY_PROMPT = """You are writing up notes from a video call that someone's assistant sat in on. You are
given the call's live captions, one line per speaker turn, as "Speaker: words". Captions are automatic, so
expect wrong words and missing punctuation; the speaker names come from the call and are reliable.

Write the notes a competent person would write:
- A title of six words or fewer, naming the actual subject. Not "Meeting notes".
- The gist: what this call was, in one or two sentences.
- The points that carry information. Merge repetition. Drop greetings and scheduling chatter.
- Decisions, only where something was actually decided, with who decided when the captions show it.
- Actions, each one a thing somebody is meant to do, with the person's name when the captions give it.
- Open questions: what was raised and not resolved.
- Anything you could not make out, said plainly, rather than a confident guess.

Every list may be empty; do not pad one. Output the JSON the schema asks for."""
