"""Sound: the owner can mute buddy. Muted means silent, not still — the head
and the LEDs keep moving; only sound stops.

Every sound buddy makes comes from the board's chirp synth, and the firmware
already gates all of it on its persisted ``sound`` setting (NVS key
``s_snd``). The host sets that setting with ``{"cmd":"sound","on":bool}`` and
re-sends it on every connect, so a reflashed or replaced board comes back
with the owner's choice. The choice itself is kept here, in
``~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/sound.json``, so it survives a daemon restart.

Two host-side belts on top of the firmware switch: caption pages go out with
``"chirp": false`` while muted (older firmware without the command stays
quiet during a conversation), and the voice never plays audio on the Mac
speaker in ``CC_BUDDY_VOICE_OUTPUT=audio`` mode.
