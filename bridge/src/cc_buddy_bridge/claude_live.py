"""Which Claude Code sessions are still alive, for the "claude on" picker.

The daemon learns of a session from its hooks and forgets it only on SessionEnd. A terminal that is closed,
killed or crashes never sends that, so its session stayed in the picker for good, and joining it typed into
whatever window was in front (docs/stackchan/telegram-bot-api.md, relay weakness 2).

The hooks carry no process id: SessionStart sends the session id, the transcript path and the folder, and
nothing else. So liveness is read from the Mac itself. ``ps`` lists the running ``claude`` processes and
``lsof -d cwd`` gives each one's working folder, both in one call each (about 30 ms together, measured
2026-09-23). A session is alive while a claude process works in its folder, or in a folder above it: the hook's
``cwd`` can be a subfolder the session's shell moved into, while the process stays where it started.

Every doubt keeps a session. The probe failing, or finding no claude process at all (a renamed binary would
look like that), answers "unknown" (None), and the picker then shows what it showed before. A session with a
permission still pending, or one that started moments ago, is never dropped either. Hiding a live session is
worse than showing a dead one: the first loses the owner's way in, the second costs one tap on a stale button.
