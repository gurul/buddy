"""Self-context: what buddy runs on right now, read from its own code and settings, for its brains to read.

The owner texted "what do you use for search" on 2026-09-29 and buddy answered from a memory record (a
``memory_search`` hit) naming an engine it had not used since 2026-09-24. Nothing in any prompt described buddy's
own wiring, so a question about it was answered from memory, and memory drifts: a record says what was true the
day it was written. This module writes a short block, one line per area, from the same ``configured()`` calls the
daemon builds its doors from, so it cannot drift from what runs:

* the models per door: the Telegram brain (telegram.py), the voice's two halves (voice_agent.py), think_hard
  (think.py) and the Mini App's builder (miniapp.py);
* web search: the providers that are usable on this environment when the search router routes
  (``search_router.available`` and ``mode``, 2026-09-29; imported defensively, so a tree without the router still
  builds the block), else websearch.py's one engine. Only live providers are named, never the full option set Jev
  is shown;
* tasks on the Mac: the agent the daemon builds for one (daemon._make_agent: holo_computer.configured's Holo when
  CC_BUDDY_COMPUTER=holo, else Codex; computer_agent.configured turns it off; 2026-09-29: the block said Codex
  while the owner's daemon ran Holo), and what a web reading task tries first (web_reader.py);
* the watcher's reading ladder (watch.py), in the order the watcher climbs it;
* the lights by brand (lights.py's file, as the daemon loads it at boot), the memory stores, the doors that are
  on, and the git commit the code runs from;
* Canvas (canvas.py), one short line and only while it is set up (2026-09-30), so the owner's "can you see my
  Canvas" is answered from what runs;
* the chief of staff (chief.py), one short line and only while it is on (``chief.enabled``: CC_BUDDY_CHIEF=on, or
  auto once its capture eval has passed). Off, the block is byte for byte what it was (P4, 2026-09-29). What the
  chief is doing lives in each turn's note (chief.for_turn), never here: this block is fixed from boot.

No value is typed here: every model, engine and brand comes from the module that uses it, and a component that
is off says so. The only fixed words are how each thing is described. Names are only ever the ones that are live
now: never a retired one, not even as "not X" (the owner's rule for prompts: a name in a prompt is a sample of
what the model says).

Each door's config carries the block (``about``), filled once in its ``configured()``: the daemon builds those at
boot from the same environment and the same lights file its live objects come from, so the block describes the
running daemon, and it is byte-identical from turn to turn, which keeps it inside the prompt cache's stable
prefix. A config built by hand (the tests) has ``about=""`` and the prompt is what it was before. Target: under
BUDGET characters, the rule sentence included (measured 2026-09-29 on the owner's environment: see the docs).
