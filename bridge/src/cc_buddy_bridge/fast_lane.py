"""The fast lane: a narrow run of clicks on labelled controls, decided locally.

`run_delegate(objective, ...)` is what the `delegate` helper calls from exec_py. Per
step it takes an accessibility snapshot (ax_candidates), builds a bounded menu in
code, asks the local typed-decision model (decider) which option advances the
objective, gates the answer in code, acts through injected effectors, settles, and
checks `done_when`. The model only ranks: every judgement that can cost the human
something — sensitive labels, dialogs, System Settings values, return into a message,
a hit-test miss, a focus change, a repeat, a stall — is a code oracle here, and the
lane can only ADD stops to the planner's ask_user contract, never remove one.

Measured cost floor of a step on this Mac (PLAN §0): AX snapshot 0.04-0.43 s, decide
8-45 ms warm, hit-test ≤ 24 ms, settle 0.33-1.0 s — against a replaced planner turn of
3.56 s API + 1.3 s exec. The honest promise is fewer failed-click recovery turns first.

The decide step is two oracles in order. First the keyword gate (`keyword_pick`): when
exactly one offered click option shares the most objective tokens (label + value, via
ax_candidates.objective_tokens) and that count is above zero, it is the pick and the
model is not asked — on the select fixtures this code-only rule is 0.90 precise at 0.66
coverage, better than the model on its own. Otherwise the model ranks the menu, with each
click option worded by decider.render_option ("Week (radio button)") and a context of the
window title (and the focused control): 0.603 top-1 on select against 0.315 for the older
"click radio button: Week" wording with the full context lines; the two together score
0.712. Every gate after the pick (sensitive, dialog, System Settings, return, repeat,
hit-test) applies to a keyword pick exactly as to a model pick; Step.via says which one
decided.

Senses protocol (the adapter lives in desktop_helpers.Helpers.delegate):

    snapshot() -> Snapshot            the frontmost app's focused window, a fresh seq each call
    text_visible(s: str) -> bool      fast OCR plus AX labels/values, right now
    focused() -> Optional[Candidate]  AXFocusedUIElement re-read now
    frontmost_pid() -> int            0 when unknown
    screen_changed() -> Optional[bool]  the helpers' thumbnail diff since the step began; None = unknown

Effectors protocol:

    click_candidate(c) -> str         re-hit-tests the centre; a sentence starting "refused:" means
                                      the element is gone, in another app, or its title differs
    focus_and_type(c, text) -> str    click, then paste only if the focused element is c; "refused:" otherwise
    press(key) -> str                 one key, never a combo
    settle(secs) -> float             wait for the screen to stop changing, up to secs; returns the wait

Result line (exact templates; values single-line, quotes escaped; the payload states are
none | pending | applied and a step applies its payload at most once):

    done: matched="{done_when}" via={ax|ocr|title}; steps={n}; last={action}; text={state}; key={state}
    stopped: reason={one_step|dry_run}; steps={n}; last={action}; pick={id role "label"}; text=…; key=…
    escalate: app="{app}"; reason={no_window|no_candidate|dialog_open|truncated|model_invalid|abstain|
              stalled|stalled_2|ambiguous_target|no_match|uncovered|hit_test_failed|focus_changed|
              step_cap|jev_error|jev_veto|jev_none}; top=[…≤3]; steps={n}; last={action}; text=…; key=…
    confirm: "{label}" needs the human's yes; app="{app}"; action={click|type|press}; steps={n};
             last={action}; text=…; key=…
    unavailable: {reason}

`last` is the last APPLIED input or none; `steps` counts steps that applied input; a
confirm guarantees the blocked action did not run; unavailable guarantees zero input.

Who decides is `decide` (DECIDE_MODES, default "keyword"): the keyword gate alone, where a tie
escalates `ambiguous_target` and zero shared words escalates `no_match`, and no model is loaded
or asked; or "model", the gate first and the model on the rest. Keyword mode clicks only: a
call with `text` or `key` answers unavailable, because the gate has never been measured on
which field to type into.

`run_script(objectives, …)` is the unit both callers above the lane use: an ordered list of
objectives, one keyword-decided click each, a fresh snapshot per step, stopping at the first
step that does not act. The planner sends exact labels in order (`delegate(steps=[…])`), so
each step's objective is its own label and the gate cannot confuse step 2's control with step
1's; the router (lane_router.py) sends the human's own clauses, with `require_cover`. Its line:

    script: {complete|partial|none}; applied=[{action}, …]; step {i}/{n} {that step's own line}

`complete` means every step either applied input that the Accessibility tree or the screen
diff saw change something, or found its control already selected. Anything less is partial
(something was applied) or none (nothing was), and the caller hands the rest to the planner.
