"""Load ``~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/env`` into the process environment.

The launchd service starts the daemon with a fixed, minimal environment, so
secrets such as ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` cannot come from the shell. They live in
a ``KEY=VALUE`` file the user owns (mode 600 recommended) and are read here
once at startup. Values already present in the environment win — the file
fills gaps, it never overrides.

File format: one ``KEY=VALUE`` per line. Blank lines and lines starting
with ``#`` are ignored, a leading ``export `` is tolerated, and a value
wrapped in matching single or double quotes is unquoted. Nothing else is
interpreted — no inline comments, no ``$VAR`` expansion.

Values are never logged. Only the key names are.
