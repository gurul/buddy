"""Tap one allowlisted key on the host, on request from the board.

A swipe on the pet sends {"cmd":"key","name":"enter"|"next"|"prev"} and the
bridge synthesizes that single keystroke, so Claude Code's option pickers can
be answered without reaching for the keyboard.

Hold-the-pet push-to-talk used to live here too — a finger on the pet held a
dictation app's global hotkey. It is gone (owner request): the board no longer
sends voice frames, and nothing here holds a modifier down any more. What is
left is the tap, which is bounded, idempotent and cannot stick a key.

Mechanics: Quartz CGEventPost at the HID tap. Taps use a NULL event source —
with a real source, Warp's global key handling swallowed Return before the
focused app saw it. CC_BUDDY_KEY_SOURCE=hid forces the real source if some
other app ever needs the opposite, and CC_BUDDY_KEY_METHOD=osascript routes
through System Events instead (Warp ignores CGEventPost synthetics).

Requires macOS Accessibility permission for the daemon's python — CGEventPost
is silently filtered for untrusted processes, so without the check the feature
would just mysteriously do nothing.
