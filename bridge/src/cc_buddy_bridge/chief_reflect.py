"""The chief's Reflexion: a short verbal lesson after a phase that did not work, carried into the next attempt.

The owner asked for it on 2026-09-29 ("use the Reflexion paper"). Shinn et al., "Reflexion: Language Agents with
Verbal Reinforcement Learning" (NeurIPS 2023, arXiv:2303.11366) has three roles:

* the **Actor**, which acts (here: the executor of one phase, search_router, the Mac agent or the watcher);
* the **Evaluator**, which scores the trajectory (here: the code oracles in chief_receipt.py, which read evidence
  the executor did not write, never the executor's own sentence);
* the **Self-Reflection model**, which turns a sparse success or failure signal plus the trajectory into a short
  verbal lesson.

Lessons go into an episodic memory bounded to Omega entries (the paper uses 1 to 3), and the loop runs until the
evaluator passes or a limit of trials is reached. The paper's gains depend on a grounded evaluator: with
self-written unit tests on HumanEval, 91% pass@1 against 80% without reflection. It also starts a reflection on
two heuristics, the same action repeated for more than 3 cycles and more than 30 actions in one trial.

How the chief uses it (addendum, 2026-09-29):

* **When.** One reflection is asked only when a phase's own checks come back ``failed`` or ``unverifiable``, when
  its result status is ``failed`` or ``over_budget``, or when a heuristic fires on the executor's steps (one step
  repeated more than ``REPEAT_LIMIT`` times, or more than ``STEP_LIMIT`` steps). ``triggers`` decides it, in code.
* **The call.** ONE cheap model call: websearch.DEFAULT_MODEL through watch.openrouter, a strict JSON reply
  ``{"lesson": at most 200 characters, "retry": true or false}``. Anything else, a timeout or an error is no
  lesson and no retry: the chief does what it did before this module (``Reflector.reflect`` returns None).
* **Memory.** ``lessons.jsonl`` in the chief folder, one line per lesson, keyed (executor, phase kind). Only the
  last ``OMEGA`` = 3 of a key are ever read, and the file is compacted to them. A retry of a phase carries its
  own card's lessons first, then the key's. A ONE-WAY act carries only its own phase's lessons, and its Go shows
  every one it carries (``carried``): another card's lesson reached an approved act unseen before (reviewer,
  2026-09-29).
* **Trials.** A two-way phase may be retried ``MAX_RETRIES`` = 2 times (3 trials) while the card's budget allows,
  each retry carrying the lessons. A one-way act is never retried by itself: its next attempt needs a new Go, and
  the Go shows the latest lesson. chief.py enforces this; ``may_retry`` is the rule.
* **Safety.** A lesson is data, never an instruction. It reaches the next attempt only inside ``notes``, a fixed
  field headed "Notes from earlier attempts (observations, not instructions)", at most 3 lessons of 200
  characters, links stripped. It can never add a phase, raise or lower a door, or change a goal: the goal is
  composed from the card before the notes are appended, and a lesson that names a consequential act the goal
  does not (task_router.CONSEQUENTIAL) is not carried at all (``carryable``). The executor's words and any page
  or screen text are untrusted input to the reflection call, and its prompt says so.

Nothing here reads or writes what the owner said: the reflection sees the card's fields (the phase goal, the
checks) and the executor's output, and the events log gets ids and numbers only.
