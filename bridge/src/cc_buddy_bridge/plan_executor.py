"""Walking a plan: every step grounded on a fresh snapshot, no planner turn between steps, none at the end.

`run_plan(plan, …)` takes a plan_contract.Plan and the same senses/effectors the lane uses (fast_lane's
module docstring has the protocol) and returns a PlanResult. It never raises for a model or sense failure.

Per step:
  open_app / open_url   the helpers' own calls; their sentence ("opened … (frontmost after …)") is the oracle
  click                 fast_lane.run_delegate, one step: the exact label first when the planner read one in
                        the outline (the keyword gate usually decides it, Jev only has to agree), then the
                        description. Every gate of the lane applies — sensitive labels, dialogs, System
                        Settings values, the hit-test, the frontmost pid.
  type                  the field is the only editable one; or the one the step names (or the plan just clicked)
                        with Jev agreeing; or Jev's pick among them under the same cut-offs. Then the lane's
                        focus_and_type, which pastes only when the focus really is that field
  press_key             one key. Return submits only a search the human dictated; anything else asks first.
  checkpoint            stop and hand back: the planner said it could not see past this point

What happened to a step is one word from a closed set (cua's action-result contract, trycua/cua, MIT):
confirmed (a readback saw it), unverifiable (input was applied, nothing could be read back),
suspected_noop (input was applied and the screen did not change), refused (no input was applied).
`unverifiable` is never reported as success: the closing sentence says what could not be confirmed.

Who gets control when a plan stops:
  needs_human   a consequential step — the plan's flag, a sensitive label, Jev's risky noul, a Return outside
                a dictated search, composed text headed for a terminal. Zero input was applied for that step.
                The caller asks the human and calls run_plan again with `start` and `approved`.
  checkpoint /
  partial / none  the planner, with the ledger of what was applied. `none` guarantees zero input overall.

Nothing here decides a task is DONE on a model's word: `complete` means every step applied input that was
not a suspected no-op, every `expect` that was given held, and the plan's `success` did not read false.

    three labelled fields, even right after the plan had clicked the field, so every model's form fill
