"""TypeSafe's Jev behind the same `predict(state, questions)` seam laya sits in.

`decider.Decider` was written against laya's System One signature, and Jev speaks that
signature over HTTP: `{"model", "state", "questions"}` in, `{"answers": {qid: {...}}}`
out, each `choice` answer carrying `choice` + `probabilities` + `confidence`. That is
the envelope `Decider._parse_choice` already parses, so this module is a transport, not
a translation — `predict` hands the decoded body straight back.

The shape is taken from browser-use/jev-ultrafast (MIT, `jev_ultrafast/model.py`), which
posts to the same service: `state` may be a dict, `criteria` values may be dicts, and
`answers` is keyed by the question id the caller chose. Its `validate_choice` is the same
set of assertions `_parse_choice` makes, so an answer that passes there passes here.

TWO ROUTES, one envelope:
  "typesafe"   POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone      Bearer TYPESAFE_API_KEY
  "openrouter" POST https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha/decisions Bearer OPENROUTER_API_KEY
The first is the one jev-ultrafast exercises and the default here. The second is alpha;
it answers in the same envelope and is the route this Mac runs (2026-09-21: the head
classifier, the request router, and tools/jev_step_eval.py's 155 four-question requests
with 26 options each, 234 ms p50). A different envelope would read as `error`, never a
wrong click.

WHAT THIS CHANGES ABOUT THE BUDGET: laya's head holds 256 tokens and cuts every option
once they overflow it, so `Decider` trims the tail of the option list before predict.
Jev takes 32k. The budgets below are set past any real AX menu, so `trim_options` never
drops an option and `overflow` never fires — the two numbers fast_lane.py gates on stay
about the model, not about the wrapper.

WHAT IT COSTS: laya decides in 11.6 ms p50 on this Mac. Jev is a network call; TypeSafe
publish 70-500 ms, this Mac measures 234 ms p50, and jev-ultrafast's 7.07 s is one whole
11-action browser task (about 0.64 s an action), not a step. Against
fast_lane's own cost model (+3.5 s a right click, -4.55 s a wrong one) half a second of
latency is small and accuracy is the whole question, which is why `timeout_s` is short
and every failure escalates to the planner rather than waiting.

WHAT IT COSTS THE OTHER WAY: laya never leaves the Mac. Jev is a third party, and the
state carries the focused window's title and visible text. The daemon only builds that
state during a computer-use task the user spoke, but it is a new egress and the README's
"nothing leaves the Mac" no longer covers this lane when it is on. It is off by default.
