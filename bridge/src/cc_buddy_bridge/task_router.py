"""The request classifier: which engine should carry a computer-use request.

Every request that reaches `start_task` used to go to the planner (gpt-6-astra: a screenshot,
a 3.4 s turn, a few lines of Python, another turn to say so). The owner's own run logs say what
those requests are (79 runs, 2026-09, ~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/agent-runs):

    about a quarter   "Open Spotify", "Open up a terminal", "open Apple TV on my Mac"   8–32 s each
    about a quarter   "Search Google for …", "pull up the weather in SF on Google"     9–25 s each
    a handful         in-app navigation ("year view and then next year")               10–19 s each
    the rest          looking and telling, typing, playing, ordering, long tasks       10–120 s

The first two rows need no model at all: `open -a Spotify` and one search URL. So the
classifier is tiers, cheapest first, and each tier declines unless it is sure:

    reflex   code only          launch an installed app; open a web search          ~1 s
    lane     code only          lane_router.py: a request one labelled control      ~1–2 s
                                fully accounts for, clicked before the planner
    astra    the planner        everything else: vision, reading, typing, judgement 10 s+
             (+ lane script)    and it may hand the lane exact labels in one turn
             (+ decider)        with CC_BUDDY_FAST_LANE_DECIDE=model the lane asks a
                                typed-decision model (laya local, jev hosted) on ties

`classify()` is pure: text in, a Plan out, no I/O — so it costs microseconds in the daemon and
is measured offline (tools/route_eval.py) against the owner's real requests. A Plan names the
tiers to try IN ORDER; the last is always astra unless a reflex fully answers the request.

What makes a tier decline is as important as what makes it engage:

- A request that asks to be TOLD something ("tell me the temperature you see") needs eyes. A
  reflex may still do the first part (open the search) and the planner starts from there.
- A CONSEQUENTIAL request (send, order, delete, quit, kill, pay, post, …) is the planner's,
  because only the planner has ask_user. No reflex and no lane touches it.
- A request with text to type ("write this into Warp: …") is the planner's.
- A launch reflex needs the app to be INSTALLED (the same list lane_router uses), and the
  request to be nothing but the launch once the filler is gone ("on my laptop", "for me").
- A search reflex needs explicit search wording and a query. "Pull up something cool" has no
  query a rule should invent; the planner picks one.

Where laya and jev fit, by measurement rather than by hope (docs/stackchan/routing.md): as the
lane's tie-breaker under the planner, and as candidates for THIS classifier's fuzzy cases —
tools/route_eval.py scores them on the same labelled requests the rules are scored on.
