"""The controller: a second board, next to the robot, that only takes input and shows state.

The owner asked on 2026-09-26 for the StackChan to stay the robot (face, head, camera) while a Home Assistant
Voice PE (firmware/buddy_voice_pe, docs/voice-pe.md) becomes the control: hold its button to talk (desk_call.py),
tap it for Enter on a waiting prompt, turn its dial through the choices. Both boards are ESP32-S3s on the same
``/dev/cu.usbmodem*`` glob, so the controller is named by its USB serial number, ``CC_BUDDY_CONTROLLER_SERIAL``
(an ESP32-S3's is its MAC, printed by ``python -m serial.tools.list_ports -v``), and the robot's glob skips it.

The robot link stays the daemon's one link (``Daemon.ble``): every status poll, ack, watchdog and resync is the
robot's. The controller gets a copy of what it can show — the heartbeat, the time, the conversation state and
the sound setting — and its lines go back to the daemon only when they are input: ``ptt``, ``key``, ``focus``.
Its acks never reach the robot's ack waiters.
