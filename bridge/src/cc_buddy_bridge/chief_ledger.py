"""The chief of staff's ledger: the cards on disk, their events, and what is due.

Everything lives in one folder, ``~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/chief/`` (``CC_BUDDY_CHIEF_DIR`` moves it; the tests
point it at a temporary folder), never in the repo, mode 600 for the files and 700 for the folder:

    cards.json     the cards and ``last_id``, written atomically
    events.jsonl   append-only: one line per created, revised, state, asked, answered, approved, dispatched,
                   result, checked, pushed, would_push, critic, reflected, retried, reopened or redacted event

The store is the Watcher's (watch.py:2033-2092), for the same reasons:

* **Atomic.** A temp file in the same folder, then ``os.replace``. A crash or a failed rename mid-write leaves
  the old file whole; the change is not taken in memory either, and the caller gets ``LedgerError``.
* **An unreadable file is moved aside,** as ``cards.json.bad-<ts>``, and the owner is told once
  (``take_problem``). So is a file that parses but is not the ledger's shape (a list, a string, ``cards`` that is
  not a list). When single cards do not load (a hand-edit's typo, a number too big), the rest load, the whole
  file is COPIED aside first and the owner is told which ids: the next save writes only what loaded, and without
  the copy it would erase the rest for good (reviewer, 2026-09-29). A hand-edit's typo never costs a card.
* **Ids are never reused.** ``last_id`` is saved; a bad file's highest ``c<N>`` and every id in the events log
  count too, so an id the log already speaks of is never handed out again, even after the cards file is lost.

The events log is the audit log's shape (audit.py): one JSON object per line, appended, never rewritten except by
``redact``. ``event`` returns whether the line reached the disk (flushed and fsynced): a dispatch or a push is
logged BEFORE the act, and a caller that gets False does not act. That is what lets a restart tell "dispatched,
no result" from "never sent" (design rule 13: an act with a dispatch line and no result never runs again without a
new yes). Event lines carry ids, numbers and short code words, never what the owner said.

State changes (status, a phase's status or result, what was spent) go through ``update`` and ``update_phase``,
which only touch the state fields. What the owner agreed to changes only through ``revise`` (chief_card.revise:
rev+1, the door add-only, approvals cancelled).

Forget does not reach this folder yet: memory.NOT_COVERED names it, and ``redact`` is the helper a forget layer
will call.
