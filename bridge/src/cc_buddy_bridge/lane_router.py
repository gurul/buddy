"""The router: the fast lane before the planner's first turn.

A planner turn is 3.5 s (logged median) and a task needs at least two: one to act, one to
say so. The paired A/B of 2026-09-21 showed why putting the lane UNDER the planner did not
pay: the planner spends a turn to call the helper, so a two-click task went from 13.1 s to
16.9 s. The lane pays when it runs INSTEAD of the planner. That is only safe when the human's
own words leave nothing to interpret, and this module is the code that decides that:

    "switch to week view"            → one control, Week, accounts for every word → click it
    "year view and then next year"   → two clauses, each fully accounted for     → two clicks
    "open notes"                     → names another installed app               → planner
    "find the email from Sam"        → words no control accounts for             → planner
    "what is on my calendar"         → a question                                → planner

The rule, all of it code (fast_lane.uncovered_tokens does the word arithmetic):

1. Refuse a question, an empty goal, a goal over MAX_GOAL_TOKENS words, and a goal whose words
   name an installed app other than the frontmost one ("open notes" is a launch, not a click
   on a folder called Notes).
2. Try the whole goal as one step with `require_cover`: the keyword gate must pick exactly one
   control, and that control's label and role, the app's name and GENERIC_WORDS must account
   for every word. "privacy and security" is one row, so the whole goal is tried before it is
   split.
3. Only if that escalates with zero input (no match, a tie, uncovered words) and the goal has
   2–MAX_CLAUSES clauses, run the clauses as a script, each under the same rule.

Every gate of fast_lane.py still applies to every step: a sensitive label, a dialog, a System
Settings value, a hit-test miss all stop the lane with zero input, and the planner — with its
ask_user contract — takes over. The router never types and never presses a key.

What the caller gets is a RouteResult. `complete` means every clause was done and each click
was seen to change something (the AX diff or the screen diff said True; unknown is not proof),
so the task can end on `sentence` with no planner call. `partial` means something was clicked:
the planner starts from there and is told what. `none` and `refused` cost one AX snapshot
(0.04–0.43 s measured) and the planner runs as it always did.
