"""Which body carries a task that is not a reflex: the owner's computer (Codex, or the Chrome lane) or Firecrawl.

Firecrawl (web_reader.py) is a hosted web-reading service: it searches the public web and reads public pages
in its own browsers, behind its own proxies, and buddy reports what it found as text. It has none of the owner's
accounts, cannot reach the Mac or a local address, and as buddy uses it never clicks or types. For a lookup on
the public web it is seconds where driving a browser is tens of seconds, and it never takes over the owner's
screen. (The body before it was an isolated browser, retired 2026-09-23 before it was ever wired in.)

Jev decides, asked the way TypeSafe documents for a routing decision (docs.typesafe.ai: State, Choice
"Structured instructions and criteria", Intent routing, Jev 1.13 jaggedness), and the way typed_ask.py asks it
everywhere else:

* The state is the request and nothing else — no tool manuals in the state ("context rot").
* The two bodies are the options of one Choice, each described as structure: ``what`` it is, ``for``, and
  ``not_for`` — the facts from each tool's own docs, the boundary written into both sides so a literal reader
  cannot confuse them.
* Beside the Choice, absolute Nouls, one judgment each (Jev reads literally; "a Choice is relative, each
  Noul is absolute"): does the request need the owner's own accounts or data? anything on the Mac or a local
  address? something shown on the owner's screen? clicking, typing or a form? and is the whole job reading
  public web pages, reported back as text?
* Code combines them and owns the safety rule: Firecrawl only when the job is reading the public web, needs
  none of the owner's accounts, nothing on the Mac, nothing on screen and no clicking or typing, AND the Choice
  picks it with enough weight. An unsafe route is a task that needs the owner (their accounts, their data,
  their Mac) sent to Firecrawl: it would fail, and its request text would have gone to a third party. Every
  cut-off is fitted with zero unsafe routes allowed — tools/route_eval.py --browser, on a blind holdout.
