"""The fast path into the owner's logged-in Chrome: plan once, execute in buddy's own tab, Codex as the floor.

Owner, 2026-09-23: "i want buddy to be able to control logged in browser, that's the most important".
Codex already drives the owner's Chrome; this is the faster road to the same browser. The daemon holds ONE
browser_lane.BrowserLane in attach mode for its whole life — Chrome asks "Allow remote debugging?" per
connection, so one connection means one click per Chrome session, not one per task. For each task:

1. A fresh ComputerAgent (the planner, gpt-6-astra) runs ``run_in_browser``: one plan against the page in
   buddy's tab, executed step by step with Jev grounding each click, a sensitive step (buy, send, delete…)
   stopping for the owner's yes (consent.py), and a code check of each step's expected result.
2. Finished: that is the answer. Stopped by the owner's no: that is the answer.
3. Part done: the rest goes to Codex with a note of what was already done, so nothing is repeated.
   Nothing done (no plan, the lane unreachable, the owner not clicking Allow): Codex takes the whole task,
   exactly as before this module. "Nothing done" has a clock: when no plan is executing and no step has been
   reported NOTHING_DONE_BUDGET_SECS after the start, the lane is stopped and Codex takes the task then. A
   plan that has started runs to its end.

``ChromeLaneAgent`` keeps the run/steer/cancel/status contract every door already uses, so it drops in behind
app_reflex.ReflexFirstAgent as its second body (make_auto) with no change to the voice or Telegram doors.

# Production, 2026-09-23/24: once connected, the lane reached a plan's first step (or gave up) 4-6 s later; the
# runs that did nothing still spent 11.3 s and 25.6 s before handing on (19 s of it one profile lookup, now
# budgeted at 3 s), and one waited 36 s on Chrome's Allow until the owner pressed Stop. 15 s is about twice
