"""Hold to talk on the board: the Telegram Mini App's push-to-talk call, on the desk.

The owner asked on 2026-09-26 for the Voice PE's button to work "like telegram": hold it, talk, let go, and
buddy answers. That is phone_call.Call — each press is one message to the same brain the owner texts, every
reply read back — with the phone swapped for the desk:

* **The button** (``{"cmd":"ptt","on":bool}`` from the board) is the phone's ``talk`` / ``done``.
* **The Mac microphone** (the same device the wake word uses, ``CC_BUDDY_MIC``) is the phone's audio. It is
  opened only while the button is held.
* **The speaker** plays buddy's reply, where the phone played it: the Voice PE's own speaker when it is the
  connected controller (``BoardSpeaker``, streamed as ``{"cmd":"pcm"}`` lines; owner, 2026-09-26: "route the
  sound of this through voice pe"), else the Mac's (``Speaker``).
* **The board's ring** shows the call's state through ``{"cmd":"agent","state":..}``: listening, thinking,
  speaking.
* **The head follower** (follow.py) hears the call as a conversation through ``on_phase``: ``listening``
  from the call's start (between presses too, since the person is still there), ``thinking`` and ``speaking``
  from the ring, ``idle`` when the call ends. Without it buddy never looked at whoever was talking on a desk
  call: the ring's states went straight to the board and never reached the follower.

``DeskLink`` is the stand-in for phone_call.WebSocket: the only change to the call itself is where its bytes
come from and go to. A call starts on the first press and ends after ``phone_call.QUIET_SECS`` without one,
like a phone that went quiet; the next press starts a new one. One call at a time across phone and desk: the
chat has a single listener.
