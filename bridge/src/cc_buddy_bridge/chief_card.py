"""The chief of staff's record: the Card that holds every job the owner hands buddy and every commitment they make.

The owner asked for a chief of staff (2026-09-29): work with more than one step is never delegated without a
card, and every card starts with buddy's backbrief ("I intend to …; done when …; up to $X"). buddy writes the
brief; the owner only corrects it. The idea is Marquet's "I intend to" (Turn the Ship Around!, 2012) and the
army's backbrief (FM 6-0, 2022, "Backbrief"): the one who will do the work says it back before starting.

A card is one of two kinds (``KINDS``):

* ``job``         buddy does the phases: research, assess, act, watch (``PHASE_KINDS_LIVE``).
* ``commitment``  the owner acts; buddy holds the cue ("remind me Thursday to …") and has no phases.

What code decides here, never a model:

* **The parse is strict and whole.** ``parse`` takes the brain's ``take_on`` arguments and returns a Card or a
  ``Refusal`` naming the first problem. One bad phase, one unknown check, one date that is not a date refuses
  the whole card, so a card is never partly made (plan_contract.parse_plan, plan_contract.py:94-136, does the
  same for a plan). Text
  fields are cut to their caps, as plan_contract's ``_text`` does.
* **The door is a floor in code and add-only.** A phase is ``one_way`` when task_router's ``CONSEQUENTIAL``
  wording matches its goal (task_router.py:70), when a Composio call in it has consequential slugs
  (composio_tools.consequential_slugs, composio_tools.py:150-161), or when its executor cannot stop and ask.
  Every ``act`` is one-way by that last rule (``ACT_CANNOT_ASK``): an act runs on the Mac with no one watching
  it, so it gets its Go before it starts. The verb pattern alone let "cancel my streaming plan" run with no Go
  (reviewer after P4, 2026-09-29: cancel, unsubscribe, RSVP, text are not in it). A card
  stored before that loads with the act's floor too (``_phase_from``, add-only).
  The brain may raise a door to ``one_way``; it can never lower one, and a revision keeps the higher door of
  each phase (plan_contract's add-only ``consequential``, plan_contract.py:13-15).
* **``grounded``** says whether the owner's own words carry the consequential verb of a one-way goal. A Go
  shows it when it is False: the verb came from buddy's plan, not from the owner.
* **The words stay in the transcript.** A card keeps ``source.said_ref`` (the transcript day and time), never a
  copy of what was said, so forget reaches them where they live (memory.py).
* **``rev`` counts changes to what the owner agreed to**: the take_on fields. An approval is bound to (card,
  phase, rev) and a new rev cancels it. Progress (status, a phase's status and result, what was spent, the
  nudges) is state: it is logged in the ledger's events and does not bump rev, so a yes is never cancelled by
  its own dispatch. (The design said "every change is rev+1"; that would void each Go at the moment it is used.)

Only live names are in these sets: a phase kind or a check that is not built yet is not named anywhere, not even
as a refusal (the owner's rule for prompts and tool enums, 2026-09-09). ``Live`` lets a caller narrow the sets it
offers; ``parse`` refuses anything outside the set it was given.

The result every executor returns (``PhaseResult``) is defined here, beside ``Phase``, because a card carries
its phases' results; chief_receipt.py re-exports it and holds the oracles that read it.
