"""Which provider answers a web search: a quick page reader, a many-source search engine, or live data services.

Every web search buddy makes goes through ``answer`` here: the brain's ``web_search`` tool (websearch.search, for
voice, Telegram and think) and the web reader body (web_reader.WebReaderAgent, for a public-web task). Three
providers, each good at a different job (2026-09-29):

* **tinyfish** (tinyfish.py, web_reader.search_and_read + answer_from): free (docs.tinyfish.ai, 2026-09-29).
  Search returns titles, snippets and links; Fetch reads the top pages; a cheap model answers only from those
  pages. Good for one fact, opening hours, a definition, a price on a public page, what one page or doc says, a
  simple comparison from a few pages. Weak at many-source synthesis, breaking news and multi-hop research.
* **perplexity** (websearch.engine_search): OpenRouter's web_search server tool, about $0.005 a search plus the
  answer model; it led OpenRouter's BrowseComp, HLE and WideSearch benchmarks (websearch.py). Good for synthesis
  across many sources, current events, multi-step research and anything ambiguous. The safe default.
* **firecrawl** (firecrawl.py): paid credits, with Alexandria's live data tools (Google Flights and Skyscanner
  fares, government records, ...). Worth it only when a data tool fits: live fares, prices from a data service,
  official records.

Jev decides, asked the way browser_router.py asks it (docs.typesafe.ai: State, Choice "Structured instructions
and criteria", Intent routing; typed_ask.py's idiom):

* The state is the request, beside one line saying who is asking and what the text is (a search query buddy's
  brain wrote, or the owner's own request) — no provider manuals in the state ("context rot").
* ALL THREE providers are the options of one Choice, on every Mac, whichever keys it holds (2026-09-29: the
  question never varies, so the gates fitted on one machine hold on every other; a pick whose key is missing is
  masked in code to perplexity). Each option is written as ``what``, ``for`` and ``not_for``, the boundary in
  both sides. The wording names no brand, so Jev reads the job, and a provider can change behind a key without a
  refit.
* Beside the Choice, four absolute Nouls, one judgment each: does it need live structured data a data service
  holds? does the correct answer change over time or hang on recent news (so a page may be stale)? does it need
  many sources weighed together or several searches in a row? can one or two ordinary pages answer it?
* Code combines them and owns the rule: firecrawl only when its Choice probability AND the structured-data Noul
  clear their fitted gates; tinyfish only when its probability AND the single-lookup Noul clear theirs AND both
  the changes-over-time Noul and the many-sources Noul are under their maximums; everything else is perplexity.
  An error, a timeout, a missing key, a provider that fails or finds nothing, today's Firecrawl cap spent:
  perplexity. A wrong route is a request labelled perplexity or firecrawl sent to tinyfish (a thin answer from
  too few pages), or anything not labelled firecrawl sent to firecrawl (paid credits for pages a free reader
  reads). Every cut-off is fitted with ZERO wrong routes allowed on the seen sets (tools/route_eval.py --search:
  search_tuning.json + search_holdout.json) and scored once on the blind search_holdout2.json against the bar
  pre-registered beside SHIPPED.

Time (2026-09-29): a routed tinyfish or firecrawl attempt runs in a worker under an outer budget
(``SearchConfig.routed_secs``, CC_BUDDY_SEARCH_ROUTED_SECS, 10 s for the brain; READER_ROUTED_SECS for the web
reader, whose tasks may take longer); past it the router stops waiting and perplexity answers with its own
timeout: the brain's whole search is at most about 2 s (Jev) + 10 s + the engine's 20 s. Firecrawl fare answers
measured 6.9-7.8 s end to end (three live questions, 2026-09-29), inside the 10 s. Cost: ``cost_usd`` is a float only when
every part of the answer was priced; a Firecrawl credit with no price (CC_BUDDY_FIRECRAWL_USD unset) or an answer
model that reported no cost makes it None ("unpriced", as spend.py records it), never a partial figure.

``SHIPPED`` is True since the 2026-09-29 blind holdout passed its pre-registered bar (below GATES), so
``CC_BUDDY_SEARCH_ROUTER=auto`` routes whenever a second provider is usable. ``off`` leaves every search exactly as it
was: the brain on websearch's engine, the web reader on TinyFish.
