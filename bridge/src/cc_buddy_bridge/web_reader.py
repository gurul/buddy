"""The web body: a task that is only reading the public web, answered in seconds without driving a browser.

browser_router.py (Jev) sends a task here only when it is a public-web reading job that needs none of the owner's
accounts, nothing on the Mac, nothing on screen and no typing into a site. Then:

1. ONE TinyFish search with the request as its query (tinyfish.py; free, 30 a minute), then ONE TinyFish fetch
   that reads the top few result pages as markdown. Pages up to an hour old may come from TinyFish's cache
   (``ttl``): fast, and fresh enough for a lookup; a score or a forecast older than that is read again. A page
   that cannot be read is represented by its search snippet.
2. ONE cheap model call (websearch.DEFAULT_MODEL through OpenRouter) answers from those pages only. The pages are
   someone else's text: the model is told to ignore any instruction in them, and the links buddy sends back are
   only the pages it actually read (a page's words cannot add a link of their own; the WatchLink lesson).
3. The pages do not answer it, TinyFish fails, the day's cap is spent, or anything else goes wrong: Codex takes
   the whole task, exactly as before this body existed. Nothing is ever lost by trying here first.

ROUTED (2026-09-29, search_router.py): when the search router is on (``CC_BUDDY_SEARCH_ROUTER``), the same Jev
router that picks the brain's search provider picks this body's: TinyFish as above for a one-fact or one-page
task, Firecrawl's search with its Alexandria data tools (``answer_from``'s ``tools`` / ``tool_result``) for live
fares and official records, and the many-source engine search (websearch.engine_search) for everything else and
after any provider fails. Whichever answered, only links buddy read come back, and anything it cannot answer
still goes to Codex. Off (the default until the router's gates pass a blind holdout): TinyFish alone, as above.
A routed TinyFish or Firecrawl attempt is bounded too (search_router.READER_ROUTED_SECS, 90 s, longer than the
brain's 10 s because a task may run a data tool), and Firecrawl calls share one daily cap with the brain's
searches (firecrawl.py, CC_BUDDY_FIRECRAWL_PER_DAY); this body's own cap (CC_BUDDY_WEB_READER_TASKS) counts
tasks, not paid calls.

``WebReaderAgent`` keeps the run/steer/cancel/status contract every door already uses (like chrome_lane), so it
drops in behind app_reflex.ReflexFirstAgent as a named body with no change to the voice or Telegram doors.
