"""Optional practice references through TinyFish search; learner work and images are never sent.

Only the topic and level leave the Mac. One TinyFish search and one fetch of its top three results
(web_reader.search_and_read, through the watcher's guarded http_request) give the pages as markdown; the tutor
uses them as inspiration for an original, adapted problem. Exa did this until 2026-09-26, with its content
moderation on; TinyFish's search has no such option (docs.tinyfish.ai, 2026-09-29), so the tutor prompt, which
adapts rather than copies, is the filter now.
