"""The chief's desk: the one gate every message it would send the owner goes through, and the briefs it composes.

Pull comes before push (design principle 6, "protect attention"). The owner reads what buddy is doing when they
ask: the first-message brief rides the reply to their first message of the day, ``/jobs`` answers with no model
call. What the chief would send on its own goes through ``Desk.offer``, which answers with one route and the rule
that decided it (``ROUTES``, ``RULES``):

* ``now``     send it.
* ``batch``   do not send it now. It waits for the next pull (the brief, ``/jobs``) or, when the route carries
              ``at``, is offered again then. Every doubt lands here: an error, a rule that cannot be read, a
              mandate that does not parse (consent.py's fail-closed rule, consent.py:1-13).
* ``silent``  shadow: it would have been sent; it is logged as a would-push and not sent.
* ``drop``    it no longer matters: the card is finished, or the owner already acted on it.

Who may interrupt, by the owner's decisions of 2026-09-29:

* **Not unprompted, sent:** a reply, a receipt, and the Go for a job the owner started. A Go waits out quiet
  hours; replies and receipts do not (a receipt belongs to work the owner started).
* **A reminder the owner asked for** is exempt from the daily budget and from the shadow week, but it still waits
  for quiet hours to end and for a breakpoint: a task ending, a relay turn ending, a wake session ending, or 90 s
  after the owner's last message. If no breakpoint comes within 45 minutes, it moves to the next slot (the brief).
* **Unprompted** (a nudge, the 80% budget warning, the evening close, the weekly sheet): only a firm commitment
  due within 2 hours may nudge; outside quiet hours; at a breakpoint; within 2 a day; after its backoff. ``CC_BUDDY_CHIEF_PUSH`` decides
  what happens when all of that passes: ``shadow`` (the default until the E5 shadow week passes) logs it as
  ``silent``, ``on`` sends it, ``off`` batches every one. In shadow the budget counts the would-pushes, so the
  shadow week measures the policy as it would run.
* **Backoff.** Each ignored nudge doubles the gap (4 h, 8 h, 16 h); after 3 ignored nudges the card appears only
  on the weekly sheet. The owner's own action on a card cancels its queued nudges and reminders (``acted``).
* **A decision never expires into an act.** ``on_expiry`` takes the choice that does not act, or none.

The budget warning was first sent as a receipt, which skipped quiet hours and the push mode; it is not one of the
kinds the owner's decisions exempt, so it is ``warn``, unprompted (reviewer, 2026-09-29). A problem with the
chief's own files is not offered here at all: it rides the reply to the owner's next message (chief.Chief.heard).

Quiet hours (22:30-08:00) and the daily budget (2) are the defaults; ``mandate.toml`` in the chief folder may set
``quiet_start``, ``quiet_end`` and ``pushes_per_day``. A mandate that does not parse falls back to the strictest
settings (the default quiet hours and no unprompted pushes) and the owner is told once.

Every verdict is one line in ``attention.jsonl`` (ids and rule words, never text), which is also where the day's
push count lives, so it survives a restart. A verdict to push that cannot be logged is not sent: an unlogged
push could break the budget. There was no quiet-hours code anywhere in buddy before this (design appendix B).

The brief, the evening close and the weekly sheet are composed by code from the ledger, so they cannot invent a
card, a deadline or a result.
