"""Firecrawl: a paid web search that reads its results, and the Alexandria data tools beside it.

buddy's web search routes here (search_router.py) only when a request needs live structured data that a data
service holds: a fare, a price from a data service, an official record. Everything else is cheaper elsewhere:
TinyFish reads pages for free, Perplexity synthesises many sources. Two calls, both ``Authorization: Bearer
$FIRECRAWL_API_KEY``, both through watch.http_request so its guards hold, both raising watch.FetchError:

* Search (``POST /v2/search``) with the request as its query, which also reads the top few result pages as
  markdown in the same call (``scrapeOptions``): 1 credit per 10 results plus about 1 per page read
  (docs.firecrawl.dev, 2026-09-26). Pages up to an hour old may come from Firecrawl's cache (``maxAge``): fast,
  and fresh enough for a lookup. With ``tools``, the same search also asks Firecrawl's Alexandria catalogue for
  data tools that fit (Google Flights and Skyscanner fares, government records, ...), with their full contracts.
* A tool run (``POST /v2/scrape`` with ``alexandria``; firecrawl-cli 1.24.6): one tool, the options the model
  picked. A provider whose terms the owner has not accepted refuses; buddy never accepts them (the owner's call).

The model sees the tools beside the pages and may pick ONE with its options instead of answering (web_reader.
answer_from's ``tools``); ``pick_tool`` checks that pick against what the search offered: a listed tool, only its
declared options, every required one present, plain values. Recovered 2026-09-29 from the Firecrawl web reader
(origin/main 523748d, web_reader.py), which TinyFish replaced as the page reader the same day.

Spend: every call is recorded under provider "firecrawl" with its credits. ``CC_BUDDY_FIRECRAWL_USD`` is one
credit's price on the owner's plan; unset, the line is recorded unpriced rather than guessed.

Daily cap (2026-09-29): ``CC_BUDDY_FIRECRAWL_PER_DAY`` Firecrawl calls a local day (default 5), counted HERE and
nowhere else, so the brain's searches and the web reader's tasks share it: every call (a search, a data tool run)
takes one in ``_post`` before it is sent, and a call past the cap raises watch.FetchError without reaching
Firecrawl. search_router also reads ``left()`` before routing to Firecrawl, and sends a spent day's request to
the many-source search with the reason logged. The web reader's own 100-a-day cap counts tasks, not paid calls.
