"""The owner approves buddy's connection to their Chrome from the phone.

Chrome asks "Allow remote debugging?" for every new connection to the owner's real Chrome (browser_lane.py,
attach mode) — the only lock between their logged-in browser and any program on the Mac. The owner is often
away from the desk (owner, 2026-09-23: "i won't be on computer to approve … text through telegram if it's
ok"), so the dialog's answer comes from them over Telegram and buddy presses the button they chose:

* It is only ever used while buddy ITSELF is connecting (``BrowserLane.connect``): the dialog it answers is
  the one buddy's own connection raised, never a prompt some other program caused on its own.
* It acts only on a dialog that reads "Allow remote debugging?" and has an Allow button — Chrome's own.
* Allow is pressed only on the owner's clear yes (consent.approves: fail-closed). No, anything unclear, no
  answer in time, or no way to ask (Telegram off): Cancel is pressed — never a dialog left hanging — and the
  task goes to Codex, which already drives the owner's Chrome without this prompt.
* ``CC_BUDDY_CHROME_ACCESS=allow`` is the owner's standing yes (owner, 2026-09-24: "Allow remote debugging
  should be allowed automatically don't ask me"): Allow is pressed at once, with no question. The two rules
  above still hold — only buddy's own connection, only Chrome's own dialog. The default is ``ask``.

The buttons are Chrome web-UI controls: macOS Accessibility's AXPress presses them (a synthetic click does
not), through the AX API directly (pyobjc), with the daemon's own Accessibility permission.
