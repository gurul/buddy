"""Live smoke test for the watcher (watch.py) against the real web. Prints WATCH_SMOKE_OK only after every check.

1. A quote: AAPL from Yahoo's chart endpoint through the real rate limiter; a positive price in USD.
2. A shop page read from its structured data with no model call (the model is a fake that fails if called).
3. A shop that refuses a plain read (HTTP 403) read through headless Chromium, still with no model call.
4. Vision (about $0.001 on OpenRouter): the vision model reads a price off a real product screenshot, and
   recognises a real bot check ("press & hold") as blocked.

Needs the network, Playwright's Chromium, and OPENROUTER_API_KEY (read from ~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/env).
Shop pages change; when one stops serving what a step needs, the step says which and the run fails loudly.
Usage: .venv/bin/python tools/watch_smoke.py
