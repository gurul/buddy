"""The voice gate on recordings: how much of the owner is lost, how much of everyone else gets through.

    .venv/bin/python tools/voice_gate_eval.py --wake wake.wav --owner me1.wav me2.wav --other tv.wav guest.wav
    .venv/bin/python tools/voice_gate_eval.py --wake wake.wav --wake-secs 0.8 --owner … --other …   # a short wake

Replays wav files through the REAL gate (voice_gate.SpeakerGate in `on` mode) with the REAL speaker model, in
100 ms blocks on a fake clock, exactly as voice_agent._pump_mic feeds it: the wake clip enrols, then the
owner's clips and the others' clips are streamed in the order given, a second of quiet between them.

It prints, per clip, the seconds of SPEECH forwarded and silenced, and the two numbers that matter:

    owner speech silenced      the robot going deaf to its owner   (bar, fixed 2026-09-21: ≤ 5 %)
    other speech forwarded     what the gate exists to stop        (bar: ≤ 20 %; with the gate off it is 100 %)

The cut-offs in voice_gate.GateConfig are NOT fitted. Fit them on recordings from the room buddy lives in —
the owner at 0.5, 1.5 and 3 m on different days, one-word answers, other people, a TV, buddy's own voice from
the Mac speaker — split by recording day into a set to fit on and a set scored once. `shadow` mode
(CC_BUDDY_VOICE_GATE=shadow) collects real score distributions with no recording at all: it logs every
decision's score and changes no audio.

Nothing here is written anywhere: the wavs are read, the numbers are printed.
