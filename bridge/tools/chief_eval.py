"""Score the chief of staff's capture (design 5.2 E1): does the real Telegram brain file a card when it should.

    .venv/bin/python tools/chief_eval.py --capture                    # score the blind set ONCE (live luna, cents)
    .venv/bin/python tools/chief_eval.py --capture --check-default    # assert chief.SHIPPED equals the verdict (G7.3)

The blind set (tests/fixtures/chief/capture_holdout.json, 2026-09-29) was written by another agent that had not
seen the code, and its sha256 (capture_holdout.sha256) was committed before the scoring. Each case is one owner
message, labelled ``card`` (hand it to the chief: ``acceptable_done`` lists the done kinds that would prove it) or
``no_card`` (today's tools answer it).

**What is asked, exactly.** The Telegram brain as the daemon builds it (daemon.py ``_make_telegram``), with the
chief on: the owner's env file loaded the daemon's way (envfile.load_env_file over the launchd plist's bare
environment, PATH and HOME), telegram.configured() (luna, its effort, self_context's block), the real tools and
instructions (TelegramInlet._turn_parts: memory, the second brain, the watcher, Meet, the lights, Spotify, the
owner's Composio apps, the app maker, the chief's take_on and jobs_list), and the turn's note (turn_context plus
the chief's line). Each case is the first message of a fresh chat, sent through TelegramInlet._think itself, so the
request is byte for byte the one a text would make. Three things differ, all on the side of doing nothing: the
chief's ledger and the spend rows go to a temp folder (the owner's real ones are never read or written), mem0 is not
opened (the live daemon holds its one opener; the memory tools are the same fixed list either way), and the
Composio session is resumed from a copy of its state file. **No executor runs**: TelegramInlet._tool is replaced by
a recorder that stops the turn at the first tool call, so the round-1 tool choice is the decision scored (design
5.1 R1: take_on or the other tools). A take_on's arguments are also run through chief_card.parse (pure code) to
report refusals; nothing is filed.

**PRE-REGISTERED BAR** (design 5.2 E1, copied here and next to chief.SHIPPED on 2026-09-29, before any scoring;
the scoring rules below were fixed at the same time). On the blind set (>= 60 cases, >= 20 card, >= 20 no_card),
scored exactly once, pass needs all of:

    (a) cards on no_card cases <= 10%                  (no_card cases whose round 1 called take_on / no_card cases)
    (b) of card cases that got a card, >= 90% have a done kind in acceptable_done
                                                       (at least one done_checks kind is in the case's list; no
                                                        card on any card case at all fails (b))
    (c) cards that ask a question <= 25%               (take_on calls whose question is a non-empty string / all
                                                        take_on calls, on any case)
    (d) one-way phases dispatched without a Go = 0     (``dispatched`` lines in the eval's events log; with no
                                                        executor it is 0 by construction, so the one-yes-one-act
                                                        tests, ``ONE_YES_TESTS``, are cited beside it)

Missed captures (card cases with no card) are reported, not gated: they fall back to today's tools. A case whose
request still fails after ``ATTEMPTS`` tries, or whose reply the turn cannot read, counts against every gate it
touches (fail-closed): on a no_card case it is a card; on a card case it is a card with no acceptable kind that asks
a question. A pass sets chief.SHIPPED = True; otherwise it stays False. Nothing is tuned after the scoring.

The verdict is kept in capture_result.json beside the set (case index, label, what the brain did: never the
owner's words, nothing from their profile), with the set's sha256. ``--check-default`` recomputes the bar from
those rows, deterministically and offline, and asserts chief.SHIPPED equals it; before a scoring it asserts
SHIPPED is False. A second ``--capture`` refuses: a blind set is scored once.
