"""slither.io as a real-time eval of the local typed-decision model (laya-mlx): hunt, kill, grow.

Not a product feature: a measurement of how a code-owned candidate menu plus the
local model holds up at 15-20 decisions a second on a live game against other
people. The pattern is the drone-racing / sampling-rollout one: code samples
candidate actions, rolls each forward, scores risk and gain, and the model picks
among the survivors; a deterministic shield executes only safe picks. Kills are
the primary metric (Guru, 2026-09-21: "you have to terminate other players"),
length second.

    .venv/bin/python tools/slither_eval.py --episodes 3 --max-secs 300
    .venv/bin/python tools/slither_eval.py --dry-run --secs 10      # read, plan and print; move nothing

Perception is the game's own state over the Chrome DevTools Protocol: a SEPARATE
Chrome (own profile, remote-debugging port) on http://slither.io, one
Runtime.evaluate per decision that does the feature extraction INSIDE the page
(FEATURE_JS) and returns a compact JSON; the websocket stays open. Globals in
build game1107249518.js, verified live 2026-09-21: `window.slither` (own snake:
xx, yy, ang radians, sp, ssp = normal speed 5.79, sc scale, sct segments, fam,
pts[{xx, yy}]), `window.slithers` (every snake incl. own by id, each with pts[],
dead_amt, alive_amt), `window.foods` [{xx, yy, sz}], `window.grd` (map radius;
centre is (grd, grd)), `window.playing`, `window.rank`, `window.fpsls`/`fmlts`
(score tables). The older `snake`/`snakes`/`setAcceleration` names do not exist
in this build. Measured: cruise 180 world units/s (sp 5.79), boost 330 units/s
(sp 14), a 90° turn in ~0.35 s at scale 1 (turn rate ≈ 4.5/sc rad/s), width
round(sc·29); the y axis points DOWN and ang grows clockwise on screen (the mouse
straight below the centre reads +π/2). Boost is refused by the game at the
minimum length (score 10) — grow first.

Actions are real HID input through Quartz CGEventPost (a post costs 0.004 ms;
pyautogui.moveTo cost 12.8 ms with its catch-up sleep): the head sits at the
canvas centre and steers toward the mouse, so a heading is a MouseMoved (or
LeftMouseDragged while the button is held) at centre + 150·(cos a, sin a);
boost is LeftMouseDown held while allowed, LeftMouseUp otherwise, and the
button is released in a `finally` on every exit including Ctrl-C.

The state text the model sees names the controls — steer toward the mouse;
hold to boost, which burns length — then length, boosting, the nearest big head,
the nearest smaller snake, the wall, the distance to the map centre and the
kills so far. One predict carries two questions: `move` (at most 8 candidates,
code-described) and `boost` (noul).

Candidates and scores (code): 16 relative headings × {cruise, boost}, plus
"Cut off smaller snake" intercepts (predict the target head's path, reach a
point ~100 ahead of it before it does; kill score = P(intercept) × its length),
"Trap: circle the small snake" when one is inside our reach, "Dead snake food"
rushes to a death burst unless a bigger head is closer, and "Head to the map
centre" whose score rises with our distance from the centre (that is where the
players are). Every candidate is rolled forward 0.6 s against the wall (radius
grd−300), enemy body points and enemies' PREDICTED head positions; risk = the
minimum clearance, gain = food mass swept in a corridor two widths wide.

Objective, strict priority (Guru): (1) TERMINATE — whenever a feasible kill
exists (a smaller head within reach whose intercept we win), the cut-off / trap
option outranks every food option, in every state, from length 12 up; (2) EAT —
otherwise the best food or burst; food within 150 of the path is always free;
(3) SURVIVE — the shield, with the risk tolerance against BODIES relaxed to
0.7 × DANGER for at most 0.6 s while a cut-off is being executed (never against
a head, never the wall). The mode (terminate | eat) is timed per episode.

Shield: a pick with clearance under DANGER (60 + our width) is never executed
— the model's pick is rerouted to the NEAREST safe heading; boost only when length > 12,
the chosen path is clear for 500, never toward a head, and one of: a food
cluster of mass > 60 within ±60°, a cut-off, a bigger head within 300 behind or
beside us. The model's noul approves food/centre boosts; kill and escape boosts
are the code's call (a "no" would forfeit the intercept). Every intervention is
recorded. Kills are counted strictly in the page: an enemy that dies
(dead_amt > 0) or vanishes while its head is within 400 of any point of our body.

Recording: one JSONL per episode under ~/.config/cc-buddy-bridge/slither-runs/.

# updates it keeps executing the last one. REFLEXES in code override both. Everything is logged
