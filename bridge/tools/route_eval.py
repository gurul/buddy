"""Score the request classifier (task_router.py) on labelled requests, and decide if reflexes ship.

    .venv/bin/python tools/route_eval.py                      # the rules, and the ship decision
    .venv/bin/python tools/route_eval.py --check-default      # …and assert task_router.REFLEX_DEFAULT equals it
    .venv/bin/python tools/route_eval.py --model laya         # a typed-decision model asked the same thing
    .venv/bin/python tools/route_eval.py --model jev          # the contrast: one relative question (sends the request TEXT out)
    .venv/bin/python tools/route_eval.py --model jev --native # Jev asked in its own idiom (typed_ask.py), alone and after the rules

The dataset (tests/fixtures/routes/requests.json) is the owner's own computer-use requests from
the run logs, de-duplicated and with personal details replaced, plus authored hard cases. Each
has the route a human judged cheapest that is still complete and safe.

What is scored is the decision that matters: does a REFLEX fire, which one, and with the right
slot. Three classes — launch, search, other — because "lane" and "astra" differ only in what
the live window holds, which no text classifier can see (the lane's own router decides that,
and is measured by tools/fastlane_eval.py --router).

    precision   of the reflexes that fired, how many were the labelled reflex with the right slot
    unsafe      a reflex that fired on a request labelled planner-only (consequential, typing,
                look-and-tell). This is the number that must be zero.
    coverage    of the requests labelled as a reflex, how many got one

The ship bar is fixed here, before the first run (2026-09-21): precision ≥ 0.95 on ≥ 15 fired
reflexes, zero unsafe. A model arm is scored the same way with a three-way band borrowed from
matrixorigin/Astra's admission classifier and TypeSafe's confidence-routing recipe: act only at
p ≥ 0.80, otherwise abstain — and abstain always means the planner.
