// Host-look rules ({"cmd":"look","yaw","pitch","hold"}), kept pure so
// host/hostlook_test.cpp can check them without a board.
//
// The owner can now tell buddy where to look by voice ("look behind you",
// "a bit up and to your left"). That request outranks the robot's own
// head choreography for as long as its hold lasts:
//   - it is taken during a voice conversation whatever the persona state,
//     because the owner asked for it out loud;
//   - outside a conversation the old rule stands: calm states only
//     (sleep / idle / busy), never while the owner is wanted;
//   - never with a permission card up or while the dictation key is held.
// While it holds, the conversation's phase poses and micro-beats stand
// aside (body.cpp), so buddy keeps looking where it was told while it
// answers, instead of snapping back to centre on the next phase change.
