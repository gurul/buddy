// A pet that is showing words is awake.
//
// The persona sleeps whenever Claude Code is idle (derive() in main.cpp), and
// a voice conversation or a thought caption is not Claude Code activity. So
// buddy used to close its eyes under its own reply, and the "zzz" status word
// flashed into the caption band whenever a page ran out before the next one
// arrived: the status row (y 186..204) sits on the caption band's 4th line
// (y 181). Owner, 2026-09-10: "the sleep appears in the middle of text".
//
// While a caption is up, and for kTextLingerMs after the last one, the face
// (eyes and status word) presents P_SLEEP as P_IDLE. Only the face: the body
// keeps its sleep pose, so buddy does not chirp "sleepy" and drop its head
// between every page. Every other state passes through unchanged.
//
// Pure, no Arduino dependency: covered by host/face_test.cpp.
